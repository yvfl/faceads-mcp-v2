# Changelog



The latest Graph API version is:

v25.0

The Marketing API changelog documents [versioned](#versioned) and [out-of-cycle](#outofcycle) changes to the API.

## 05/04/2026

### Marketing API Access Tier (formerly Ads Management Standard Access)

- Renamed: "Ads Management Standard Access" → "Marketing API Access Tier"
- New tier labels: "Standard Access" → "Limited access" | "Advanced Access" → "Full access"
- Auto-approval threshold lowered: 1,500 → 500 Marketing API calls in 15 days
- Error rate calculation updated: rolling 500-request window (< 15%)
- Screen recording requirement removed for tier upgrade submissions

### Versioned changes {#versioned}

Versioned changes are introduced with the release of a new API [version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/versions). Versioned changes typically apply to the newest version immediately and often will apply to other versions at a future date. The changelog accompanying each release indicates which changes apply to the current release and which changes apply to other versions.

Refer to our [Upgrade Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/upgrading) to learn how to upgrade to a new API version.

### Out-of-cycle changes {#outofcycle}

Out-of-cycle changes are introduced outside of our normal, versioned release schedule and typically do not apply to a specific version. Instead, out-of-cycle changes usually apply to all API versions immediately.

The content of out-of-cycle changes, captured every two weeks, is automatically generated based on the API changes and is reflected in the files in the [API spec](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-business-sdk-codegen/tree/main/api_specs/specs) folder.
