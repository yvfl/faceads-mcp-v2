# Partner-publisher Lists API



Partner-publisher lists show publishers that have signed up for monetization and follow our Partner Monetization Policies. The lists are available for each of these placement types: Facebook in-stream videos, Audience Network, and Ads on Facebook Reels.

Additional documentation you can review or share with advertisers in the Meta Business Help Center:

## Permissions
* The app requires the `brand_safety_third_party_partners` capability grant.
