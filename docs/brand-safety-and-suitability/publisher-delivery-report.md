# Publisher Delivery Reports API



Delivery reports provide approximate impressions information at the publisher level and the content level. They give greater transparency into where advertisers ads appeared.

While we apply brand suitability controls as effectively as possible, we can't guarantee that all content and publishers will be compliant or aligned with advertisers unique brand suitability standards.

During or after a campaign, delivery reports provide approximate publisher impression information for Facebook Pages (in-stream video ads, overlay and ads on Reels), Instagram accounts (Ads in Instagram profile feed) and Audience Network apps (rewarded videos and native, banner and interstitial ads).
