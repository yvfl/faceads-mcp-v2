# Publisher Block Lists API


**Warning:** **Ads Management Standard Access is now Marketing API Access Tier**

**No code changes are needed.**

Tier labels have been updated: "Standard Access" is now **Limited Access**, and "Advanced Access" is now **Full Access**. The revised qualification threshold for Full Access has been reduced from 1,500 to **500 Marketing API calls** in the past 15 days. The underlying permission identifier remains the same, and existing access levels are preserved automatically. Learn more in the [Marketing API Access Tier documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference#marketing-api-access-tier).

Block lists stop advertiser's ads from appearing in places they don't consider suitable for their brand or campaign. This can include apps in Meta Audience Network, Facebook in-stream videos, ads on Facebook Reels and Instagram profile feed.

Additional documentation you can review and/or share with advertisers:

* [About Block Lists \| Meta Business Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/255483958155378?id=1769156093197771)

## Permissions

* The app requires the `block_list_management_v2_api_access` capability grant.

## Create a New Block List

### 1. Create a new draft block list from a file containing URLs.

Initiate the creation process by making a POST request to the `block_list_drafts` edge of a business node and specifying the block list file in the `publisher_urls_file` parameter:

```curl
CURL POST \
-F "publisher_urls_file=@path/to/local/file.txt" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BUSINESS_ID>/block_list_drafts
```

The response will be of the form:

```json
{"id":<BLOCK_LIST_DRAFT_ID>}
```

Depending on the size of the publisher URLs file, it might take a longer time to finish draft creation.

In order to make this status check, your app (not access token) needs to have ["ads_read", "ads_management" permissions and "Marketing API Access Tier"](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/app-types) features.

To get the status and progress of the block list draft creation process, query the `block_list_draft` node with `async_job_status` and `async_percent_completion` fields:

```curl
CURL -X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_DRAFT_ID>?fields=async_job_status,async_percent_completion&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

The response will be:

```json
{"id":<BLOCK_LIST_DRAFT_ID>,
 "async_job_status":"running",
 "async_percent_completion":80}
```

Possible statuses are: scheduled, failed, running, success. As long as the status is 'success' it is possible to perform the next step.

### 2. Create a new block list from the draft block list.

Make a POST request to the publisher_block_lists edge of a business node:

```curl
curl \
-F "draft_id=<BLOCK_LIST_DRAFT_ID>" \
-F "name=<BLOCK_LIST_NAME>" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BUSINESS_ID>/publisher_block_lists
```

The response will be a newly created or updated publisher block list id:

```json
{"id":<BLOCK_LIST_ID>}
```

Parameters:
| Parameter | Type | Required (Y/N) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Y | Name for the block list. |
| draft_id | fbid | Y | ID of the draft block list. |

## Update an Existing Block List

First, create a new draft block list.

Next, make a POST request to the `publisher_block_lists` edge of a business node using the draft ID from the previous step:

```curl
curl \ POST
-F "block_list_id=<EXISTING_BLOCK_LIST_ID>" \
-F "draft_id=<BLOCK_LIST_DRAFT_ID>" \
-F "name=<BLOCK_LIST_NAME>" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BUSINESS_ID>/publisher_block_lists
```

The response will be a newly created or updated publisher block list id:

```json
{"id":<BLOCK_LIST_ID>}
```

Parameters:
| Parameter | Type | Required (Y/N) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Y | Name for the block list. |
| draft_id | fbid | Y | ID of the draft block list. |
| block_list_id | fbid | N | ID of the block list to update. |

## Get a Block List

Make a GET request to the `publisher_block_lists` edge:

```curl
curl -X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>?fields=id,name,last_update_user,last_update_time,business_owner_id,owner_ad_account_id,items_count,web_publishers,app_publishers&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

The response will be the requested info for the block list:

```json

## Delete a Block List

A block list must first be unshared from all Business Managers before it can be deleted.

Make a DELETE request to the `publisher_block_lists` edge:

```
curl -X DELETE \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

## Share Block Lists with Other Businesses

### Share a Block List

Make a POST request to the `agencies` edge:

```
curl \
-F "agency_id=<BUSINESS_ID>" \
-F "permitted_roles=['<ROLE>']" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/agencies/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Role options: *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST*, *MANAGE_BLOCK_LIST*

The *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST* role allows the business to apply the block list to whatever that business currently has access to (campaigns, ad accounts, and/or the business itself).

The  *MANAGE_BLOCK_LIST* role grants the same ability as the *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST* role, in addition to the ability to update the block list contents with a new block list draft. **[This will impact the original shared block list and any other businesses using the same block list ID.]**

In order to change the role to *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST* if the block list has already been shared with the *MANAGE_BLOCK_LIST*,  unshare the block list first and then re-share with the *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST*.

### Unshare a block list
Make a DELETE request to the  `agencies` edge:  

```
curl \
-X DELETE \
-F "agency_id=<BUSINESS_ID>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/agencies/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

### Get business IDs a block list is shared to
Make a GET request to the  `agencies` edge:

```
curl \
-X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/agencies/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

## Roles Management within Business

After sharing a block list with another business, admins of that business need to assign people access to the block list in order to apply and/or manage the block list (whichever is applicable based on the above block-list-to-business sharing specification). If the other business grants admin access to manage their Business Manager settings, the below API calls can be used to assist in this user-level roles management process.

See more on what kind of API calls are offered via the [Business Manager API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/business-manager-api) Documentation

### Assign role to a user
Make a POST request to the  `assigned_users` edge:

```
curl \ POST
-F "user=<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>" \
-F "permitted_roles=['<ROLE>']" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/assigned_users/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Role options (same as block-list-to-business sharing): *APPLY_BLOCK_LIST*, *MANAGE_BLOCK_LIST*

The response will be:

```
{"access_status":"CONFIRMED"}
```

### Remove assigned role for a user
Make a DELETE request to the  `assigned_users` edge:

```
curl \
-X DELETE \
-F "user=<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/assigned_users/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

### Get the assigned role of a user
Make a GET request to the  `assigned_users` edge:

```
curl \
-X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/assigned_users/?business_id=<BUSINESS_ID>&access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

## Applying and Unapplying a Block List Directly to an Ad Account
If the other business grants *View Performance* access to one of their ad accounts, the below API calls can be used to directly apply and unapply a block list to that ad account (without the need for sharing).

There are 3 parameters for the apply and unapply call:

* *account_id*: ad account ID to apply/unapply the block list against.
* *business_id (optional)*: the business ID that owns the block list and has access to the ad account above.
* *is_auto_blocking_on*: boolean, true/false.

### Apply block list to ad account

To apply a block list to an AdAccount, specify the *account_id* and set *is_auto_blocking_on* to true:

```
curl -X POST \
-F "account_id=<ACCOUNT_ID>" \
-F "business_id=<BUSINESS_ID>" \
-F "is_auto_blocking_on=*true*" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/auto_applied_ad_accounts"
```

The response will be the block list ID used in the call:

```
{"id":"<BLOCK_LIST_ID>"}
```

### Unapply block list to ad account

To unapply a block list from an AdAccount, specify the *account_id* and set *is_auto_blocking_on* to false:

```
curl -X POST \
-F "account_id=<ACCOUNT_ID>" \
-F "business_id=<BUSINESS_ID>" \
-F "is_auto_blocking_on=*false*" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/auto_applied_ad_accounts"
```

The response will be the block list ID used in the call:

```
{"id":"<BLOCK_LIST_ID>"}
```

### Get ad accounts a block list ID is applied to

This will only return the ad account IDs that had the block list applied to them **using the above Apply API calls**. To determine which ad accounts a **shared** block list has been applied to, see what kind of API calls are offered via this [ad account insights Marketing API](reference/ad-account/insights.md) Documentation.

Make a GET request to the `auto_applied_ad_accounts` edge:

```
curl -X GET \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BLOCK_LIST_ID>/auto_applied_ad_accounts/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

The default response will be a list of the ad account IDs in JSON array format:

```
{"data":[{"id":"act_<ACCOUNT_ID>"},{"id":"act_<ACCOUNT_ID>"},...]}
```

See more on what kind of API calls are offered via this [ad account Marketing API](reference/ad-account.md#Reading) Documentation.
