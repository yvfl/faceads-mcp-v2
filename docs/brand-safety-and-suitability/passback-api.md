# Passback API



The Brand Safety and Suitability Passback API is a system that allows Meta Business Partners (MBPs) to share content
risk labels and campaign performance data with Meta.

The goal of this system is to provide advertisers and third parties with a mechanism to give feedback on content,
for Meta to be able to take action on that feedback, and allow for Meta and partners to compare content labels.

## Permissions

This API requires the capability grant `brand_safety_feed_verification` to the app.
