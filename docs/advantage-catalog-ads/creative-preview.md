# Standard Enhancements Preview



**Warning:** Starting with Marketing API v22.0, previews for [standard enhancements](advantage-catalog-ads/standard-enhancements.md) will no longer be available. Instead, you can get the previews of individual Advantage+ Creative features by following the instructions in [Get Started with Advantage+ Creative](creative/advantage-creative/get-started.md).

The sub-features within the standard enhancement bundle for single image ads include `image_template`, `image_touchups`, `text_optimizations`, and `inline_comment`. For single video ads, the sub-features are `video_auto_crop`, `text_optimizations`, and `inline_comment`.

The Advantage+ Creative Preview API supports generating previews for ads both before and after publishing the ad.

* Provide the creative ID or ad ID to see previews of published ads
* Provide the creative spec to see previews of unpublished ads

### Limitations

* Advantage+ Creative previews are currently only supported on the `MOBILE_FEED_STANDARD`, `INSTAGRAM_STANDARD`, `INSTAGRAM_REELS` and `INSTAGRAM_STORY` placements.

* Image ad previews on `MOBILE_FEED_STANDARD` may appear cropped, even without manual crops, because the placement supports a limited range of aspect ratios. See [Aspect ratios supported by placements in Meta Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/682655495435254?id=271710926837064&helpref=faq_content) for more information about aspect ratio support for each placement.

* The following transformations in Standard Enhancements do not have preview support:
    * Inline Comment
    * Text Liquidity
