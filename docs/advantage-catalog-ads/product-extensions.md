# Product Extensions for Advantage+ Creative



[Product extensions (the "Add catalog items" feature in Meta Ads Manager)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/336325168874197) is an Advantage+ creative optimization that showcases products from your catalog below your static single media when it's likely to improve performance. This document shows you how to use product extensions features for ads.

**Warning:** #### API Support for Product Extensions
Product extension creative creation is supported in all versions of the Marketing API, but beginning with v20.0, all ad creation requests that are eligible for product extensions must specify if the ad opts in to use it or not. The `enroll_status` field must be provided with either an `OPT_IN` or `OPT_OUT` value.
