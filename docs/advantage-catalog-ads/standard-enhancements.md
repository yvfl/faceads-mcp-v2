# Standard Enhancements for Advantage+ Creative



**Warning:** Starting with Marketing API v22.0, opting in or out of standard enhancements will no longer be available. Instead, you can opt in or out of individual Advantage+ Creative features by following the instructions in [Get Started with Advantage+ Creative](creative/advantage-creative/get-started.md). Opting in or out of sub-features within the standard enhancements bundle will have the same effect as previously opting in or out of standard enhancements.

The sub-features within the standard enhancement bundle for single image ads include `image_template`, `image_touchups`, `text_optimizations`, and `inline_comment`. For single video ads, the sub-features are `video_auto_crop`, `text_optimizations`, and `inline_comment`.

Standard enhancements is for ads using a single image, video, or carousel. It automatically creates multiple variations of your ad and shows a personalized variation to each Account Center account based on what they're most likely to respond to. You can create ads with standard enhancements using the `TRAFFIC` or `CONVERSIONS` objectives to generate tailored ad variations for each Account Center account.
