# Create an ad set



After creating your ad campaign, the next step is to create an ad set to add to your campaign. The ad set contains the bidding, targeting, and budget information for your campaign.

To create an ad set within your campaign, send a `POST` request to the `/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` endpoint. Specify the `name` of the ad set, the associated `campaign_id`, `targeting` specifications, and `daily_budget` details.

**Example API request:**

```curl
curl -X POST \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets \
  -F 'name=My Ad Set' \
  -F 'campaign_id=<CAMPAIGN_ID>' \
  -F 'daily_budget=1000' \
  -F 'targeting={"geo_locations":{"countries":["US"]}}' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

## Required parameters
