# Threads App Ads



[App ads](mobile-app-ads.md) are available for Threads. To deliver to Threads, include both `instagram` and `threads` under `publisher_platforms` in your ad set. Then, use the `threads_stream` placement. Remember that you must also select the Instagram `stream` placement.

To create an ad creative for Threads app ads, include the `instagram_user_id` and `threads_user_id` as part of the ad creative's `object_story_spec` parameter.

## Limitations

Threads app ads have the following limitations:

* Threads supports mobile app install and app engagement ads. Threads does not support [desktop app install ads](mobile-app-ads.md).
* Image, video, and carousel app ads are supported. Threads does not support playable app ads, and playable app ads will render as video ads on Threads.

## Before you begin

* Make sure you are familiar with the basic [Threads ads creation](ad-creative/threads-ads/creation.md) process.

    }
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
