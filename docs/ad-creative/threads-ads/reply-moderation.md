# Threads Ads Reply Moderation



Reply moderation lets you manage the conversation on your Threads ads by reading replies, hiding inappropriate content, and adding your own replies. For general information about advertising on Threads, see the [Threads Ads overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/threads-ads).

### Limitations {#limitations}

* Only direct replies to ad media are supported for both fetching and replying. Nested replies (replies to replies) are not available through either operation.
* Only text replies can be added. Image, video, and carousel replies are not supported.
* Supported ad types include single image ads, single video ads, carousel ads, Placement Asset Customization ads, static posts, and existing posts.
* Unsupported ad types are Advantage+ catalog ads and boosted posts as well as ads created by Instagram-backed and Page-backed Threads accounts.

## Before you begin

You will need:

* A Meta app with the Marketing API product enabled
* An ad account with an active Threads ad
* An ad of one of the supported ad types (see [Limitations](#limitations))

### Permissions

These permissions are required for the ad account that owns the ad:

* `ads_read` — for reading ad media and replies
* `ads_management` — for hiding and adding replies

## Hide or unhide replies on a Threads ad

To hide or unhide a reply on your Threads ad, send a `POST` request to the `/{reply-id}/manage_reply` endpoint. Hiding a reply removes it from public view but does not delete it.

### Response fields

| `success`<br><br>Boolean | Returns `true` if the reply was successfully hidden or unhidden. |

### Example request

```html
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/<REPLY_ID>/manage_reply" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -d "hide=true"
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Add replies to a Threads ad

To add a text reply to your Threads ad, send a `POST` request to the `/{reply-id}/add_reply` endpoint. Only text replies are supported.

**Note:** Your app must have the `ads_management` permission to use this endpoint.

### Parameters
