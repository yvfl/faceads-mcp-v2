# Ads that Click to Multidestination



This guide explains how to create and publish ads that click to multidestination using the Marketing API.

To create a multidestination ad, configure an ad campaign, ad set, ad creative, and ad through the Marketing API. When someone clicks the ad, it opens a conversation with the business in one of the messaging apps (Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp) that the person is most likely to respond from.

A multidestination ad can open any combination of these destinations: Messenger chat, Instagram chat, and WhatsApp chat.

If you'd like to create an ad that only goes to one destination, see:

* [Ads that Click to Messenger](ad-creative/messaging-ads/click-to-messenger.md)
* [Ads that Click to Instagram](ad-creative/messaging-ads/click-to-instagram.md)  
* [Ads that Click to WhatsApp](ad-creative/messaging-ads/click-to-whatsapp.md)

### Ad creation overview

This document outlines the steps you need to follow to set up your integration for click to multidestination ads. You will need to:

1. [Create an ad campaign](#step-1)
2. [Create an ad set that links your ads to your ad campaign](#step-2)
3. [Create an ad creative for the Multi Destination ad type you want to serve](#step-3)
4. [Create an ad by linking your ad creative to your ad set](#step-4)

## Before you begin

This guide assumes you have:

* [An ad account with Meta](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/)
* [Uploaded any assets, such as images or videos, to be used in your ads to Meta servers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/attachment-upload-api)

| `special_ad_categories`<br><br>list<Object> | **Required.**  <br>Special ad categories associated with the click to multidestination campaign.
