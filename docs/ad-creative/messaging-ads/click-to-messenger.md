For more information about icebreakers, see the [`ice_breakers` reference](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/messenger-profile-api/ice-breakers).

## Step 4. Create the Ad  {#ad}

To create the ad you need to associate the ad creative and the ad set. To create the ad, send a `POST` request to the `/act_***ad_account_id/ads***` endpoint where ***ad_account_id*** is the ID for your Meta ad account.  Your request must include:

* `access_token`
* `adset_id` (from [Step 2](#adset))
* `creative_id` (from [Step 3](#ad-creative))
* `name`
* `status`

#### Ad Account Ads Quick Reference
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `access_token` | Your Page access token |
| `adset_id` | The AD-SET-ID from Step 2 |
| `creative_id` | `{"creative_id": "AD-CREATIVE-ID"}` where AD-CREATIVE-ID is the ID from Step 3 |
| `name` | The name for this ad |
| `status` | Set to `PAUSED`. Set to `ACTIVE` when you are ready to launch your ad campaign |

#### Ad with Creative Example Request
*Formatted for readability. Replace **bold, italics values**, such as **ad_account_id**, with your values.*

```curl
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_ad_account_id/ads"
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     -d '{
           "access_token": "Your_page_access_token",
           "adset_id": "Your_ad_set_id",
           "creative": { "creative_id": "Your_ad_creative_id" },
           "status": "PAUSED"
         }'
```

On success your app receives the following JSON response with the ID for the ad.

```json
{
  "id": "ad_id"
}
```

### Call to action

You can also set a call to action when creating your ad.

```
"call_to_action": {
  "value": {"app_destination":"MESSENGER"},
  "type": "MESSAGE_PAGE"
}
```

## Step 5. Publish your Ad {#publish-ad}

Verify that your ad exists in the
[ads manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com). Click the **Review and publish** button in the upper right corner. Select your campaign, the ad set for the campaign, and the ad.

You can publish your ad from the ads manager or using the API. To publish using the API, repeat [Step 4](#ad) with the `status` parameter set to `ACTIVE`.

Your ad will be reviewed by Meta and the status will be `PENDING_REVIEW`. Once approved, the status will be `ACTIVE` and your ad will be delivered.

## Advanced Click to Messenger Elements

You can create messages that include more than one message element, like a call prompt or multiple templates. You will add these elements by setting an array of objects for the `*_data.page_welcome_message` value instead of a string value.

#### Page Welcome Message Array Quick Reference
| `page_welcome_message` Parameters | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `landing_screen_type ` *enum* | Set to `call_prompt` – **Required** |
| `media_type` *enum* | Set to `text` for a call prompt ad |
| `message` *object* | Use to include one or more message templates in your Click to Messenger ad |
| `text_format.message` | Object to define the call prompt button actions<br><br>• `text` – Your welcome message text<br>• `call_prompt_data ` – The call prompt message text key-value pair – **Required**<br><br>Set `call_prompt_message`  to your text to prompt a person to call your business.`}` For example, *Call to make an appointment.*  – **Required**<br> |

### Add a Call Prompt

You can add a call prompt to your Click to Messenger ad by setting the value of `*_data.page_welcome_message` to an array of objects that define your call prompt elements. Set the `landing_screen_type` parameter to `call_prompt`, `media_type` to `text`, and the `text_format.message` object  with `text` to your welcome message text, and `call_prompt_data.call_prompt_message` set to a prompt to call your business.

*Formatted for readability. Replace **bold, italics values**, such as **page_access_token**, with your values.*

```
...
      "page_welcome_message": "[
        {
          "landing_screen_type": "call_prompt",
          "media_type": "text",
          "text_format": {
            "message": {
              "text": "Your_welcome_message",
              "call_prompt_data": {
                "call_prompt_message": "Your_call_prompt_message"
              }
            }
          },
        }
      ]"
...
```

### Add One or More Templates

To create an ad with multiple templates set `*_data.page_welcome_message` parameter to an array with a
[message template](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/send-messages/templates)
The following example adds a template for a quick reply.

*Formatted for readability. Replace **bold, italics values**, such as **page_access_token**, with your values.*

```curl
...
      "page_welcome_message": "[{
        'message': {
          'text':'  Your_question_or_directive',
        'quick_replies':[
          {
            'content_type':'text',
            'title':'  Option_1',
            'payload':'  Option_1_information_for_webhook'
          },
          {
            'content_type':'text',
            'title':'  Option_2',
            'payload':'  Option_2_information_for_webhook'
          },
          {
            'content_type':'text',
            'title':'  Option_3',
            'payload':'  Option_3_information_for_webhook  '
            }
          ]
        }
      }]",
...
```
