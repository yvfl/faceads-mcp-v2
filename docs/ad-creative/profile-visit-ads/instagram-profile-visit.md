# Instagram Profile Visit Ads


**Warning:** Profile visit ad creation on the Marketing API is in limited availability and is being rolled out incrementally to advertisers. If you do not have access, contact your Meta representative or create profile visit ads in [Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/).

This guide explains how to create and publish Instagram profile visit ads using the Marketing API.

Instagram profile visit ads send people who click on your ads directly to your Instagram profile. Use these ads to drive profile traffic and create more opportunities for people to discover and engage with your business on Instagram.

If you want to create an ad that sends people to a Facebook Page instead, or to both Instagram and Facebook, see:

* [Facebook Page visit ads](ad-creative/profile-visit-ads/facebook-page-visit.md)
* [Multidestination profile visit ads](ad-creative/profile-visit-ads/multidestination-profile-visit.md)

### Ad creation overview

This document outlines the steps you need to follow to set up your integration for Instagram profile visit ads. You will need to:

1. [Create an ad campaign](#step-1)
2. [Create an ad set that links your ads to your ad campaign](#step-2)
3. [Create an ad creative for the Instagram profile visit ad](#step-3)
4. [Create an ad by linking your ad creative to your ad set](#step-4)

## Before you begin

This guide assumes you have:

* [An ad account with Meta](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/)
* A Facebook Page with an [Instagram business account connected to it](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/instagram/ads-api/guides/pages-ig-account)
* [Uploaded any assets, such as images or videos, to be used in your ads to Meta servers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/attachment-upload-api)

## Step 1: Create an ad campaign {#step-1}

Start by creating your ad campaign. To do this, make a `POST` request to the `/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` endpoint where `<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>` is the ID for your Meta ad account. Your request must include:

| `special_ad_categories`<br><br>list<Object> | **Required.**  <br>Special ad categories associated with the Instagram profile visit campaign. Currently, special ad categories aren't supported for profile visit ads, so it needs to be `NONE` or empty array. See the [Ad Campaign reference](reference/ad-campaign-group.md) for more details. |
| `status`  <br><br>enum | **Optional.**  <br>Valid options are `PAUSED` and `ACTIVE`.  <br>If this status is `PAUSED`, all its active ad sets and ads will be paused and have an effective status `CAMPAIGN_PAUSED`. |
