# Multidestination Profile Visit Ads


**Warning:** Profile visit ad creation on the Marketing API is in limited availability and is being rolled out incrementally to advertisers. If you do not have access, contact your Meta representative or create profile visit ads in [Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/).

This guide explains how to create and publish multidestination profile visit ads using the Marketing API.

Multidestination profile visit ads send people who click on your ad to either your Instagram profile or your Facebook Page. Meta selects the destination that each person is most likely to engage with. Use this ad type to maximize total profile visits across both surfaces with a single campaign.

If you want to create an ad that sends people to a single destination, see:

* [Instagram profile visit ads](ad-creative/profile-visit-ads/instagram-profile-visit.md)
* [Facebook Page visit ads](ad-creative/profile-visit-ads/facebook-page-visit.md)

### Ad creation overview

This document outlines the steps you need to follow to set up your integration for multidestination profile visit ads. You will need to:

1. [Create an ad campaign](#step-1)
2. [Create an ad set that links your ads to your ad campaign](#step-2)
3. [Create an ad creative for the multidestination profile visit ad](#step-3)
4. [Create an ad by linking your ad creative to your ad set](#step-4)

## Before you begin

This guide assumes you have:

* [An ad account with Meta](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/)
* A Facebook Page with an [Instagram business account connected to it](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/instagram/ads-api/guides/pages-ig-account)
* [Uploaded any assets, such as images or videos, to be used in your ads to Meta servers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/reference/attachment-upload-api)

## Step 1: Create an ad campaign {#step-1}

Start by creating your ad campaign. To do this, make a `POST` request to the `/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` endpoint where `<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>` is the ID for your Meta ad account. Your request must include:

| `special_ad_categories`<br><br>list<Object> | **Required.**  <br>Special ad categories associated with the multidestination profile visit campaign. Currently, special ad categories aren't supported for profile visit ads, so it needs to be `NONE` or empty array. See the [Ad Campaign reference](reference/ad-campaign-group.md) for more details. |
| `status`  <br><br>enum | **Optional.**  <br>Valid options are `PAUSED` and `ACTIVE`.  <br>If this status is `PAUSED`, all its active ad sets and ads will be paused and have an effective status `CAMPAIGN_PAUSED`. |
