# Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns



**Warning:** Meta is introducing a new, unified, and streamlined process for creating campaigns, replacing the existing separate workflows for Manual, Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC), and Advantage+ App Campaigns.

As of v25.0, Marketing API developers will no longer be able to use the ASC API with the `smart_promotion_type=AUTOMATED_SHOPPING_ADS` field to create ASC campaigns. Instead, developers will need to use [Advantage+ audience](audiences/reference/targeting-expansion/advantage-audience.md), [Advantage+ campaign budget](bidding/guides/advantage-campaign-budget.md), and Advantage+ placements to create campaigns with an `advantage_state` that reflects the type of Advantage+ campaign. Refer to the [Advantage+ Campaigns documentation](advantage-campaigns.md) to start creating Advantage+ campaigns today and avoid disruption with the releases of v24.0 and v.25.0.

Advantage+ shopping campaigns is a solution that enables ecommerce and retail direct-to-consumer and brand advertisers to potentially achieve better performance, greater personalization and more efficiency. These campaigns provide greater flexibility to control levers such as creative, targeting, placements, and budget, and more opportunities to optimize campaigns that drive conversions.

Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns empower advertisers to use automation and AI to:

- deliver campaigns at scale with sustained performance
- increase efficiency with minimum effort to set up and manage different campaigns

It replaces a portfolio of manual sales campaigns using a combination of targeting, bidding, destination, creative, placement, and budget set-ups within a single campaign to test up to 150 different combinations and optimize for the highest performing ads.

Learn more about the context and benefits of ASC in our [blog](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/10/31/advantage-plus-shopping-campaigns-automated-ecommerce-advertising/).

## Manual campaign setup compared to Advantage+ shopping campaigns
| Manual BAU Campaign Setup | Advantage+ Shopping Campaign |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple BAU campaigns | BAU portfolio replacement |
| Manual Targeting with  7 Targeting levers | Automated targeting, automation to increase setup efficiency with 1 country input |
| Strict budget allocations in multiple campaigns | Budget liquidity within 1 campaign |
| Test up to 50 creative combinations | Allows both dynamic and static  ads with up to 150 creative combinations |

This document outlines the steps you need to follow to set up your integration for Advantage+ shopping campaigns. You will need to:

1. [Define Existing Customers](#step-1)
2. [Create Campaign](#step-2)
3. [Verify Campaign Creation](#step-3)
4. [Create Ad Set](#step-4)
5. [Provide Creative and Create Ads](#step-5)
6. [Set Minimum Age Constraint and Geo Exclusion](#step-6) [(See Ad Account Controls reference doc)](reference/ad-account/account_controls.md)
7. Have a `pixel_id` to set up Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns

**Warning:** Learn more about [Cross-Channel Conversion Optimization for Advantage+ shopping campaigns](advantage-shopping-campaigns/cross-channel-conversion.md).

## Step 1: Define your existing customers (optional) {#step-1}

Optionally, Advantage+ shopping campaigns allow you to define your existing customers as a collection of custom audience IDs. Your existing customers are users who are already familiar with your business/product. Once this definition is set up, you can use this to segment your budget for Advantage+ shopping campaigns to limit spend on existing customers via `existing_customer_budget_percentage`. Meta also provides metrics reporting the performance of your campaigns among these different segments. This step is **not required** unless you plan on using `existing_customer_budget_percentage`.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `existing_customers`  <br><br>Array<string> | Array of custom audience IDs that the ad account has access to. Currently the supported sources for the custom audience are website, app activity, customer list, catalog, and offline activity.<br><br>For information on how to create a custom audience, refer to [this page](reference/custom-audience.md). |

#### Example

```
curl -X POST \
  -F 'existing_customers=[<CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID>, <CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID>]' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>
```

For more information on tracking new and existing audiences in third-party tracking tools, see [Audience Type URL Parameters](advantage-shopping-campaigns/audience-type-url-parameters.md).

## Step 2: Create Campaign {#step-2}

Start by creating your ad [campaign](reference/ad-campaign-group.md). To do this, make a `POST` request to
`/act_{ad_account_id}/campaigns`.

- Set `campaign_objective` to `OUTCOME_SALES`
- Set `smart_promotion_type` to `AUTOMATED_SHOPPING_ADS` to indicate that the campaign you're creating is an ASC campaign

**Warning:** ASC can be created only with the `OUTCOME_SALES` campaign objective.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name`  <br>*string* | **Required**  <br>Name for the Advantage+ shopping campaign |
| `objective`  <br>*enum* | **Required**  <br>Campaign's objective. Specify `OUTCOME_SALES` for this type of ad |

| `execution_options`  <br><br>list<enum> | **Optional**  <br>Default value: `set`. Other options are:<br><br>* `validate_only`: when this option is specified, the API call will not perform the mutation but will run through the validation rules against values of each field.<br>* `include_recommendations`: this option cannot be used by itself. When this option is used, recommendations for ad object's configuration will be included. A separate section [recommendations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-recommendation) will be included in the response, but only if recommendations for this specification exist.<br><br>If the call passes validation or review, the response will be `{"success": true}`. If the call does not pass, an error will be returned with more details. |
| `smart_promotion_type`  <br>*enum* | **Required**  <br>To specify this is an Advantage+ shopping campaign, the smart promotion type should be set to `AUTOMATED_SHOPPING_ADS` |
| `status`  <br>*enum* | **Optional**  <br>Valid options are: `PAUSED` and `ACTIVE`.<br><br>If this status is `PAUSED`, all its active ad sets and ads will be paused and have an effective status `CAMPAIGN_PAUSED` |

```

## Step 3: Verify campaign creation {#step-3}

To verify that you have successfully created an Advantage+ shopping campaign, you can make a `GET` request to `/<AD_CAMPAIGN_ID>` with the field `smart_promotion_type`.

A valid Advantage+ shopping campaign will return the field value `AUTOMATED_SHOPPING_ADS`.

```

#### Response

```
{
  "smart_promotion_type": "AUTOMATED_SHOPPING_ADS",
  "id": <AD_CAMPAIGN_ID>
}
```

## Step 4: Create Ad Set {#step-4}

Once you have completed the campaign creation, you can create an ASC [ad set](reference/ad-campaign.md). Make a `POST` request to `/act_{ad_account_id}/adsets.`

Only **one** Ad Set can be associated with each ASC campaign.

**Warning:** For ad sets targeting Taiwan, the `regional_regulated_categories` and `regional_regulation_identities` fields must be set to identify the name of the individual or organization paying for and/or benefitting from the ad. Please see the [Ad Set documentation](reference/ad-campaign.md#fields) for more details.

For a lightweight Ad Set creation:

- Set performance goal to maximize the number of conversions (`optimization_goal=OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS`)
- Use auto-bidding (`bid_strategy=LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP`)
- Target by ISO country code using `geo_locations` field
- Choose either a `daily_budget` or a `lifetime_budget.` If you choose to specify a `lifetime_budget`, you must also set the `end_time`
- Set the conversion location to website under the `promoted_object` by specifying the `pixel_id` for your website and setting `custom_event_type=PURCHASE`
- Set `billing_event=IMPRESSIONS.` This is the only supported billing event for ASC.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |

If an advertiser selects anything else, the campaign will convert to the Website conversion location<br><br>There are 2 types of cross-channel conversion configurations in `promoted_object`. Cross-channel conversion is optional. For a Website-only conversion location, specify the `pixel_id` for your website and set `custom_event_type=PURCHASE`.<br><br>1. **Website and App:** Use this if you can track the same web and app events, such as with an active Meta Pixel or Facebook SDK. You will need to specify the app information under `promoted_object` using `omnichannel_object`.<br><br>2. **Website and Shop:**<br>Use this if your business has an onsite Shop. This is for businesses with both an app and an eligible Shop. Specify Shop information by setting `destination_type=SHOP_AUTOMATIC` and using `omnichannel_object` under `promoted_object` to specify `commerce_merchant_settings_id`.<br><br>Learn more about and view configuration examples for [cross-channel conversion optimization for Advantage+ shopping campaigns](advantage-shopping-campaigns/cross-channel-conversion.md). |

## Step 5: Provide Creative and Create Ads {#step-5}

Once you have an ad set, you can create your ad by posting to the `/act_{ad_account_id}/ads` endpoint.  Creating Ads in Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns follows the same process as in manual sales campaigns. Please refer to the links below to create Ads under Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns:

- [Manual Ads (non-Catalog Ads)](reference/adgroup.md)
- [Advantage+ Catalog Ads (formerly known as Dynamic Ads)](advantage-catalog-ads.md)

### Individual Ad Scheduling
Individual Ad Scheduling allows advertisers to have more granular control to run their Ads during a specific time period by scheduling the start and end time. This feature is available for all campaign types.

#### Example

```

## Step 6: Ad Account Controls (Optional) {#step-6}

If your business has constraints, such as unable to show ads to people under a certain age, or is restricted to some countries, you can use Ad Account controls to choose how your ads are delivered. These constraints will apply across all new and existing campaigns (manual sales and ASC) across the account.

You can set the following optional features at the Ad Account Control level:

* **Minimum Age Constraint:** You can set the minimum age from 18 to 25. You cannot set the maximum age.
* **Exclude Geo Locations:** You can exclude certain locations from ad delivery based on country, state/province, city, DMA or zip code. See [targeting search](audiences/reference/targeting-search.md#targeting-search) for available values.
* **Geo Inclusions:** You can include locations at the country level.
* **Placement Exclusions:** You can exclude certain placements to prevent ads appearing on specific surfaces. Available placements for exclusions are Audience Network, Facebook Marketplace, and Facebook's Right Column. See [available values](reference/ad-account/account_controls.md#parameters-2) on the Marketing API.

### Define Constraints

Make a `POST` request to `/act_{ad_account_id}/account_controls`:

- Set `age_min` to a value between 18 - 25

- Exclude locations you do not want your Ads to deliver in using `exclude_geo_locations`

- Exclude ad placements where you do not want your Ads to appear using `placement_exclusions`

- Include a specific country

#### Example Request

```
curl -X POST \
-F 'audience_controls={
"age_min": 20,
"excluded_geo_locations": {"countries": ["US"]}' \
"geo_locations":{"countries": ["GB"]} \
-F 'placement_controls = {"placement_exclusions": ["facebook_marketplace"]} \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/account_controls
```

#### Example Response

```
{
  "id": "<ad_account_business_constraints_id>",
  "success": true
}
```
