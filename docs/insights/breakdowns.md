# Insights API Breakdowns



You can group the Insights API results into different sets using breakdowns.

The Insights API can return several metrics that are estimated, in development, or both. Insights breakdown values are estimated. For more information, see [Insights API, Estimated, and Deprecated Metrics](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/adgroup/insights).

## Limitations

### Unavailable fields

Do not request the following fields when specifying a breakdown:

* `app_store_clicks`
* `newsfeed_avg_position`
* `newsfeed_clicks`
* `relevance_score`
* `newsfeed_impressions`

### Restrictions for off-Meta action metrics

The following breakdowns will no longer be available for off-Meta action metrics.

#### Type 1

* `region`
* `dma`
* `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone`
* `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone`

#### Type 2

* `action_device`
* `action_destination`
* `action_target_id`
* `product_id`
* `action_carousel_card_id/action_carousel_card_name`
* `action_canvas_component_name`

**Rules related to queries containing above breakdowns:**

* **Type 1** — The Insights API will not return unsupported off-Meta metrics (for example, an actions metric with Type 1 breakdowns).
* **Type 2** — Off-Meta web metrics will continue to be returned from the API, however will not contain the breakdown value.
The mobile metrics will not be returned anymore when queried with these breakdowns.

**Note:** The breakdowns listed above will still be supported for on-Meta metrics such as impressions and link clicks. The changes will also not impact historical data prior to April 27, 2021; breakdowns for historical data will continue to be available.

### Action metrics

Metrics will not be available under the following scenarios:

* When there is an attempted aggregation across multiple attribution settings
* When requested with impacted breakdowns (this restriction only applies for off-Meta and action types).

**Note:** Metrics will be available if querying with `action_attribution_windows=1d_click,7d_click,1d_view,incrementality` (not including the default window).

## Generic breakdowns {#genericbreakdowns}

The following breakdowns are available.

| Breakdown | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `action_device` | The device on which the conversion event you're tracking occurred. For example, \"Desktop\" if someone converted on a desktop computer. |

| `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone` | Hourly breakdown aggregated by the time ads were delivered in the audiences' time zone. For example, if your ads are scheduled to run from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, but they reach audiences in multiple time zones, they may deliver from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm in the advertiser's time zone. Stats are aggregated into 2 groups: 9:00 am to 10:00 am and 10:00 am to 11:00 am.<br><br>**Note:** **Availability notice (effective August 6, 2026):** This breakdown may be unavailable for some ad accounts.

**Notes**

- Filtering `app_id` and `skan_conversion_id` using the `filtering` field is currently not supported.
- The `dma` breakdown is not available for the `estimated_ad_recall_rate` metric or `video_thruplay_watched_actions` metric.
- The `dma` breakdown employs a sampling methodology to compute unique metrics like reach. In instances where there are a large number of DMA regions with comparatively low volumes, those DMA regions might not be represented in the sample or could be scaled up to a power of 2. Therefore, query the corresponding impressions as well for enhanced accuracy.
- `frequency_value` is used with `reach` only. For example, how frequently a unique user saw an ad.
- By design, `image_asset` and `video_asset` breakdowns are not available at the ad account level for assets used in [Dynamic Creative](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/asset-feed).
- [Ad actions](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ads-action-stats) `video_p25_watched_actions`, `video_p50_watched_actions`, `video_p75_watched_actions`, `video_p95_watched_actions`, and `video_p100_watched_actions` do not support `region` breakdown.
- All Dynamic Creative asset breakdowns only support a limited set of metrics:
| Dynamic Creative Breakdowns | Supported metrics for Dynamic Creative Breakdowns |
| --- | --- |
| - `ad_format_asset`<br>- `body_asset`<br>- `call_to_action_asset`<br>- `description_asset`<br>- `image_asset`<br>- `link_url_asset`<br>- `title_asset`<br>- `video_asset` | - `impressions`<br>- `clicks`<br>- `spend`<br>- `reach`<br>- `actions`<br>- `action_values` |

The following call groups the results by `age` and `gender`.

## Hourly breakdowns {#hourlybreakdowns}

Hourly stats are now an available breakdown using the following breakdowns:

* `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone`
* `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone`

See [Combining Breakdowns](#combiningbreakdowns) for limits on number of breakdowns you may request with the hourly breakdown. Hourly breakdowns do not support unique fields, which are any fields prepended with `unique_*`, `reach` or `frequency`. `reach` and `frequency` fields will return 0 when hourly breakdowns are in use.

## Action breakdown {#actionsbreakdown}

Group results in the `actions` field. You can use the following breakdowns for `action_breakdowns`:

The following are the possible breakdowns that can be supplied into the `action_breakdowns` field.

If `action_breakdowns` parameter is not specified, `action_type` is implicitly added as the `action_breakdowns`.

## Total count in `actions`

The total count (sum) of all values returned in group results (`actions`).

**Note:** This result may not equal `total_actions` since fields returned in `actions` are hierarchical and include detailed actions not counted.

```
total_actions - 33
    page_engagement - 10
        post_engagement - 10
            link_click - 2
            comment - 3
            post_reaction - 3
            like - 2
    mobile_app_install - 12
    app_custom_event - 11
        app_custom_event.fb_mobile_activate_app - 6
        app_custom_event.other - 5
```

In this example, `post_engagement` is a sum of `link_click`, `comment`, `like`, and `post_reaction`, where `post_reaction` is the count of all reactions, including likes. The `total_actions` field represents a sum of top-level actions for an object, such as `page_engagement`, `mobile_app_install`, and `app_custom_event`.

## Combining breakdowns {#combiningbreakdowns}

Due to storage constraints, only some permutations of breakdowns are available. **Permutations marked with an asterisk (\*) can be joined with `action_type`, `action_target_id` and `action_destination` which is the name for `action_target_id`.**

| Permutation |
| --- |
| `action_converted_product_id` - Under limited availability for Collaborative Ads. |
| `action_type` \* |
| `action_type, action_converted_product_id`  - Under limited availability for Collaborative Ads. |
| `action_target_id` \* |
| `action_device *` |
| `action_device, impression_device` \* |
| `action_device, publisher_platform` \* |
| `action_device, publisher_platform, impression_device` \* |
| `action_device, publisher_platform, platform_position` \* |
| `action_device, publisher_platform, platform_position, impression_device` \* |
| `action_reaction` |
| `action_type, action_reaction` |
| `age` \* |
| `gender` \* |
| `age, gender` \* |
| `app_id, skan_conversion_id ` |
| `country` \* |
| `region` \* |
| `publisher_platform` \* |
| `publisher_platform, impression_device` \* |
| `publisher_platform, platform_position` \* |
| `publisher_platform, platform_position, impression_device` \* |
| `product_id` \* |
| `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone` \* |
| `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone` \* |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name, impression_device` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name, country` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name, age` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name, gender` |
| `action_carousel_card_id / action_carousel_card_name, age, gender` |

### Limitations {#combining-limitations}

- `video_*` fields cannot be requested with any hourly stats breakdowns.
- `video_avg_time_watched_actions` field cannot be requested with the region breakdown.
- `action_type` is implicitly added as the `action_breakdowns` when `action_breakdowns` parameter is not specified.
