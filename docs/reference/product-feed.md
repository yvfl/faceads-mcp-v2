[v24.0](#)

# Product Feed

[](#)

You must meet the following requirements to use Product Feed.

-   Your business must be listed in Business Manager
    
-   You must be an employee of your business, or be an employee of an Agency which is assigned to this business
    

[](#)

## Leitura

A feed is a set of items uploaded or fetched from a source at once. You can have a single feed to represent all of the items in your catalog, or you can have multiple feeds with each feed representing a single country or single division's products

### Feed Format

The Product Feed consists of a series of items in either a Tab Separated file or XML. In XML, these should exist as an array of [`<item>`'s](/docs/marketing-api/reference/product-item). In a tab separated file, the header column is required.

## Criando

You can make a POST request to `product_feeds` edge from the following paths:

-   [`/{product_catalog_id}/product_feeds`](/docs/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog/product_feeds/)

When posting to this edge, a [ProductFeed](/docs/marketing-api/reference/product-feed/) will be created.

### Parâmetros

Parâmetro

Descrição

`country`

string

Valor padrão: `"US"`

Two letter country code where the products can be sold

`default_currency`

ISO 4217 Currency Code

Valor padrão: `USD`

The default currency used by provided feed if the currency is not specified in the feed file

`deletion_enabled`

boolean

Valor padrão: `true`

Default value: `false` (to be changed to `true` .from API v2.5)  
When `true`, this will remove products from a catalog that are no longer present in a feed. When `false`, uploading a product feed is additive and products will remain in the catalog even if they are removed from a feed. Once enabled, we do not allow this field to be disabled.

`delimiter`

enum {AUTODETECT, BAR, COMMA, TAB, TILDE, SEMICOLON}

Valor padrão: `AUTODETECT`

Product feed delimiter

`encoding`

enum {AUTODETECT, LATIN1, UTF8, UTF16LE, UTF16BE, UTF32LE, UTF32BE}

Valor padrão: `AUTODETECT`

The character encoding used by provided feed

`feed_type`

enum {AUTOMOTIVE\_MODEL, COLLECTION, DESTINATION, FLIGHT, HOME\_LISTING, HOTEL, HOTEL\_ROOM, LOCAL\_INVENTORY, MEDIA\_TITLE, OFFER, PRODUCT\_RATINGS\_AND\_REVIEWS, PRODUCTS, TRANSACTABLE\_ITEMS, VEHICLE\_OFFER, VEHICLES}

Type of the feed. Decides type of catalog item this feed will create

`file_name`

string

The name of the product feed. .tsv, .xml or compressed files (zip, gzip and bz2) are supported

`ingestion_source_type`

enum {PRIMARY\_FEED, SUPPLEMENTARY\_FEED}

ingestion\_source\_type to decide type of feed i.e. primary or supplementary

`item_sub_type`

enum {APPLIANCES, BABY\_FEEDING, BABY\_TRANSPORT, BEAUTY, BEDDING, CAMERAS, CELL\_PHONES\_AND\_SMART\_WATCHES, CLEANING\_SUPPLIES, CLOTHING, CLOTHING\_ACCESSORIES, COMPUTERS\_AND\_TABLETS, DIAPERING\_AND\_POTTY\_TRAINING, ELECTRONICS\_ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE, HEALTH, HOME\_GOODS, JEWELRY, NURSERY, PRINTERS\_AND\_SCANNERS, PROJECTORS, SHOES\_AND\_FOOTWEAR, SOFTWARE, TOYS, TVS\_AND\_MONITORS, VIDEO\_GAME\_CONSOLES\_AND\_VIDEO\_GAMES, WATCHES}

The sub type of items to be uploaded by this feed

`migrated_from_feed_id`

numeric string

Used to split an original feed into multiple new feeds, `migrated_from_feed_id` denotes the original feed's ID. Setting this field ensures that items from an original field can be migrated to a new one, without the need of deletion.  
This field is generally used when splitting a large feed into multiple smaller feeds.  
Example:

1.  You have a large feed called Feed A and want to split it.
2.  You create a new feed called Feed B and specify Feed A's ID under `migrated_from_feed_id`.
3.  You upload Feed B's catalog information, including the products you want to add to Feed B.
4.  The items from feed A have been moved to feed B. Going forward, you do not need to specify those items in Feed A and they can be removed from feed A.

**Guidance on splitting feeds that exceed file size or item limit**

If your data feed contains more items or exceeds the file size, split it into multiple feeds and upload them separately. You can upload as many data feeds as you want, but they must all contain different items.

You can split the data feed into smaller feeds using `migrated_from_feed_id`.

Steps:

1.  Create a new data feed file with items that need to be transferred from the old feed.
2.  Create a new data feed using `migrated_from_feed_id`.
3.  The ownership of items will be transferred from the old feed to the new feed when the first session completes on the new feed file.
4.  Subsequently, the items can be removed from the old feed. And the items must be managed by the new feed.

Example of how to create a new feed using `migrated_from_feed_id`:

```
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="New Feed"' \
  -F 'schedule={
       "interval": "DAILY",
       "url": "http://www.example.com/new_feed_file.csv",
       "hour": "22"
     }' \
  -F 'migrated_from_feed_id=<OLD_FEED_ID>' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{product-catalog-id}/product_feeds
```

5\. Additionally, ensure that once the data feeds are split into a new, smaller feed, all item updates come from the respective new feed.

`override_type`

`schedule`

JSON-encoded string
