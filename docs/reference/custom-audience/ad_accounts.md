# POST and DELETE Custom Audience Ad Accounts



**Warning:** ### Flagged custom conversions

If a custom conversion is flagged, the `is_unavailable` field will be set to `true`.

```html
{
  "is_unavailable": true,
  "id": "30141209892193360"
}
```

#### To resolve flagged custom conversions

If any of your custom conversions are flagged for suggesting information that is not allowed under our terms, you may want to consider the following options:

To resolve a flagged custom conversion in a new campaign creation:

* **Create new custom conversion**: Use a new custom conversion and make sure that it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms.
* **Choose a different custom conversion**: Select a different existing custom conversion and make sure it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms.

To resolve a flagged custom conversion in an existing campaign:

* **Duplicate your campaign and select an existing custom conversion**: If you have a running campaign that is flagged due to a flagged custom conversion, consider duplicating the campaign and selecting a different custom conversion that is not flagged before publishing the new duplicated campaign. **Note:** Once the campaign is published, you cannot remove or select a different custom conversion.

#### Request a review

If you believe your custom conversion has been flagged in error and doesn't include non-permitted information, you can request a review via Ads Manager under the campaigns table, or in Events Manager under the custom conversions page.
