# Custom Audience Usersreplace



### Flagged custom and lookalike audiences

If the audience is flagged with an `operation_status` of `471`, you must resolve the restrictions on the customer file custom audience before you can update or delete the user memberships. Attempts to edit user memberships without resolving the restrictions will result in an error.
