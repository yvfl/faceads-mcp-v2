# Ad Set, Promoted Object



The object an ad set promotes, such as a Page  or app. The campaign's `objective` and the ad set's `promoted_object` provide intent for your ads. When you create ad sets for campaigns with the certain objectives, `promoted_object` is required. See [Ad Set, Creating](reference/ad-campaign.md#Creating).

### Requirements

- You must have permissions for objects you promote, including `page_id`, `application_id`, and `pixel_id`

- If you use `page_id`, the creative must promote that `page_id`

- If you use `pixel_id`, you must provide `custom_event_type`

- If you use `object_store_url`, you must include `application_id`. This option is only available in [Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager).

- `object_store_url` MUST be associated with that app. You can configure this under your [app settings](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

- Mobile device targeting for the ad set must match supported platforms for your specified app.

- The ad creative must link to the specified `object_store_url`.

### Limitations

If you use `promoted_object`:

- `promoted_object` is **immutable** in most cases. It is set on creation and cannot be changed. To promote a different object, create a new ad set. The exceptions are:

- Adding `application_id` or `product_catalog_id` if not already given

- Changing `pixel_id`, `pixel_rule` or `custom_event_type` to a new value when the following objectives and optimization goals are set:

- `CONVERSIONS`, `PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES`

- `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS`

- You cannot set `promoted_object`  for existing ad sets. You must create a new ad set except for the exceptions above.

- If `promoted_object` is specified, Facebook automaticallly infers `conversion_specs` for your specified objectives. You cannot manually configure `conversion_specs`; we ignore any value you pass.

- You can update all ad fields for existing ads in a legacy ad set without a `promoted_object` set.

## Reading

Promoted Object describes the object an ad set is promoting,    such as the Page in a Page Like campaign. It is a generalized way of    specifying a broad range of objects which are related to advertising    objectives.<br><br>    Taken together, the campaign's objective and the ad set's    promoted_object should be enough to answer the question: "What is this    ad set/campaign all about?". For example, "This campaign is meant to    get more page likes for my Page X", or "This ad set is driving mobile    app installs for my app Y".
