# Ad, Image



Upload and manage images to later use in [ad creative](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/adcreative). Image formats, sizes and design guidelines depend up on your type of ad, see [Ads Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/). See [Image Crop](image-crops.md) and [Ads Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/).

## Reading

Image for use in ad creatives can be uploaded and managed independently of the ad itself. The image used in an ad creative can be specified in the following ways:

- By image hash value of a previously uploaded image.
- By uploading the image at ad or ad creative creation time

## Creating

Upload an image or zip file, get back a hash, and use the hash in an ad or creative. You must include a filename extension such as `sample.jpg`, not `sample` or `sample.tmp`.

### Examples {#examples_create}

#### bytes {#example_create_bytes}

```
curl \
  -F 'bytes=iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABEAAAARCAMAAAAMs7fIAAAAOVBMVEX///87WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZg7WZhMeMJEaa5Xi9tKdb0+Xp5Wi9tXjNxThNH+wk/7AAAACnRSTlMAsHIoaM7g/fx9Zr/g5QAAAGlJREFUeNplkFsOwCAIBPGJrtbX/Q/bqm1qwnxuJrBAE6OVD15pQy/WYePsDiIjp9FGyuC4DK7l6pOrVH4s41D6R4EzpJGXsa0MTQqp/yQo8hhHMuApoB1JQ5COnCN3yT6ys7xL3i7/cwMYsAveYa+MxAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages"
```

#### Upload an Image on Create {#example_create_ad_with_img_upload}

You can upload an image instead of using an image hash when you create an ad or ad creative. Add the image file to the multi-part MIME POST and specify the file name. For example:

```
curl \
  -F 'campaign_id=<AD_SET_ID>' \
  -F 'creative={"title":"test title","body":"test","object_url":"http:\/\/www.test.com","image_file":"test.jpg"}' \
  -F 'test.jpg=@test.jpg'
  -F 'name=My ad' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<ACCOUNT_ID>/ads"
```

The response contains:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | ID of the ad |

#### Copying Images {#example_create_copy}

To copy an ad image from one account to another, make a `POST` request to `/act_{DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID}/adimages`. Provide the source account ID without the `act_` prefix and a hash of the image in `copy_from`. This copies the image from the source to the destination account. **Your app's user must have access to read the creatives from the source account** or you cannot copy images from the account.

```
curl \
  -F 'copy_from={"source_account_id":"<SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID>", "hash":"02bee5277ec507b6fd0f9b9ff2f22d9c"}'
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages"
```

### /act_{ad_account_id}/adimages
You can make a POST request to *adimages* edge from the following paths:

- [/act_{ad_account_id}/adimages](reference/ad-account/adimages.md)

When posting to this edge, an [AdImage](reference/ad-image.md) will be created.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bytes`<br><br>*Base64 UTF-8 string* | Image file. Example: `bytes = <image content in bytes format>`<br> |
| `copy_from`<br><br>*JSON or object-like arrays* | This copies the Ad Image from the source to the destination account.<br>`{"source_account_id":"<SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID>"`, `"hash":"02bee5277ec507b6fd0f9b9ff2f22d9c"}`<br><br><br>`source_account_id` *numeric string*<br><br>`hash` *string* |

#### Return Type

This endpoint supports [read-after-write](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview#read-after-write) and will read the node represented by *images* in the return type.

```
