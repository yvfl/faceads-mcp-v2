# Ad Campaign Group



A campaign is the highest level organizational structure within an ad account and should represent a single objective for an advertiser, for example, to drive page post engagement. Setting objective of the campaign will enforce validation on any ads added to the campaign to ensure they also have the correct objective.

**Warning:** The `date_preset = lifetime` parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with `date_preset = maximum`, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, `date_preset = maximum` will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any `lifetime` calls will default to `maximum` and return only 37 months of data.

### Limits

- You can only create 200 ad sets per ad campaign. [Learn more about the ad campaign structure](reference/ad-campaign-group.md).
- If your campaign has more than 70 ad sets and uses [Campaign Budget Optimization](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/bidding/guides/campaign-budget-optimization), you are not able to edit your current bid strategy or turn off CBO. [Learn more in the Business Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/519856662172206).

### New Required Field for All Campaigns

All businesses using the Marketing API must identify whether or not new and edited campaigns belong to a [Special Ad Category](audiences/special-ad-category.md). Current available categories are: [housing, employment, credit](audiences/special-ad-category.md#context), or issues, elections, and politics. Businesses whose ads do not belong to a Special Ad Category must indicate NONE or send an empty array in the `special_ad_categories` field.

Businesses running **housing**, **employment**, or **credit** ads must comply with [targeting and audience restrictions](audiences/reference/targeting-restrictions.md). Targeting for ads about social issues, elections or politics are not affected by the `special_ad_categories` label.

**Warning:** As of **Marketing API 7.0**, the `special_ad_category` parameter on the [`POST /act_<ad_account_id>/campaigns`](reference/ad-account/campaigns.md#Creating) endpoint has been deprecated and replaced with a new `special_ad_categories` parameter. The new `special_ad_categories` parameter is required and accepts an array.

If you use the `special_ad_category` parameter, it will still return a string, but you should use `GET /{campaign-id}?fields=special_ad_categories` to get an array back. Refer  to [Special Ad Category](audiences/special-ad-category.md) for additional information.

## Reading

A campaign is a grouping of ad sets which are organized by the same business objective. Each campaign has an objective that must be valid across the ad sets within that campaign.

After your ads begin delivering, you can query stats for ad campaigns. The statistics returned will be unique stats, deduped across the ad sets. You can also get reports and statistics for all ad sets and ads in an campaign simultaneously.

### Objectives and Creative Fields {#objective_creative}

See our [ads guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/) for a list of creatives supported per objective. In the API, the objective determines which [ad creatives](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/adcreative) are valid.

| Objective | Creative Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_INSTALLS` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec` |
| `CONVERSIONS` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec`<br><br>Notes:<br><br>- If you are creating link ads not connected to a page, use the following creative fields: `title`, `body`, `object_url`, and `image_file` or `image_hash`.<br>- Creative cannot include link ads pointing to an app store. |
| `EVENT_RESPONSES` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec` |
| `LEAD_GENERATION` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec` |
| `LINK_CLICKS` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec`<br><br>Notes:<br><br>- Creative cannot include link ads pointing to an app store.<br>- If you select `LINK_CLICKS` as both optimization goal and billing event, you must include `call_to_action`. |
| `MESSAGES` | `object_story_spec` |
| `PAGE_LIKES` | `object_story_id`, `object_story_spec`, `object_id`, and `body` |
| `POST_ENGAGEMENT` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec`<br><br>Note: Creative cannot include link ads pointing to an app store. |
| `VIDEO_VIEWS` | `object_story_id` or `object_story_spec` |

### Objectives and Tracking Specs {#objective_tracking}

Tracking specs are applied by default based on the objective specified, please see the full list of defaults by objective [here](tracking-specs.md#default).

There are two important scenarios to take into account:

* Tracking pixels are not applied by default, and you must specify it explicitly when your objective is `CONVERSIONS`.
* Mobile app ads will no longer track installs or app events by default. **You must explicitly specify to track installs or app events for mobile app ads otherwise your ad will not track.**

To specify to track an install or app event, set the following in your [ad](reference/adgroup.md):

```
tracking_specs=[{'action.type':['mobile_app_install'],'application':[{your_app_id}]},{'action.type':['app_custom_event'],'application':[{your_app_id}]}]
```

### Objective and Promoted Objects {#promoted-object}

Certain objectives require the `promoted_object` to be set in ad sets. See [Promoted Object](reference/ad-promoted-object.md) for more information.

| Objective | Required promoted_object Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_INSTALLS` | - `application_id` and `object_store_url`<br>- If `optimization_goal` is `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS`: `application_id`, `object_store_url`, and `custom_event_type` |
| `CONVERSIONS` | - `pixel_id` (Conversion pixel ID)<br>- `pixel_id` (Facebook pixel ID) and `custom_event_type`<br>- `pixel_id` (Facebook pixel ID), `pixel_rule`, and `custom_event_type`<br>- `event_id` (Facebook event ID) and `custom_event_type`<br>- For mobile app events: `application_id`, `object_store_url`, and `custom_event_type`<br>- For offline conversions: `offline_conversion_data_set_id` (Offline dataset ID), and `custom_event_type` |
| `LINK_CLICKS` | For mobile app or Instant Experiences app engagement link clicks: `application_id` and `object_store_url`. |
| `PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES` | - `product_set_id`, or<br>- `product_set_id` and `custom_event_type` |
| `PAGE_LIKES` | `page_id` |
| `OFFER_CLAIMS` | `page_id` |

### Objective and Placements {#placement}

Certain types of ad [placements](audiences/reference/advanced-targeting.md#placement) are valid only for specific objectives or creatives. See [Business Help Center, Available ad placements for marketing objectives](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/279271845888065?id=369787570424415).

The table below shows some placements and their compatible objectives or creatives. You can pick a combination of those compatible placements. Note that:

* With `LEAD_GENERATION`, `device_platforms: desktop` cannot be selected together with `publisher_platforms: instagram`.
* If your objective is website traffic, `story` for `facebook_positions` does not support `destination_type: messenger`.
* If your objective is website traffic, `story` for `messenger_positions` does not support `destination_type: messenger`.
* If your objective is website traffic, `ig_search` and `explore_home` for `instagram_positions` do not support `destination_type: whatsapp & messenger`.

### Objective, Optimization Goal and `attribution_spec` {#attribution_spec}
Use click-through and view-through attribution windows for [ad set](reference/ad-campaign.md#Creating) to track conversions then use for ads delivery optimization. This is different from the attribution window you use for ads reporting. With `attribution_spec`, select a combination of click-through or view-through windows of 1 day or 7 days. The combinations you can use depend on your ad set's `optimization_goal` and campaign's `objective`.

**Recommended Default `attribution_spec`**

You may not have provided `attribution_spec` when you created ads sets optimized for Value Optimization. This is an optimization available for conversions, app installs, and product catalog sales objectives. In the past, we defaulted to a 1-day click through attribution window.

| Objective | Optimization Goal | Allowed Combination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONVERSIONS, PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES` | `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS` | 1-day click<br>7-day click<br>1-day click and 1-day view<br>7-day click and 1-day view |
| `APP_INSTALLS, LINK_CLICKS` | `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS` | 1-day click<br><br>7-day click |
| `APP_INSTALLS` | `APP_INSTALLS` | 1-day click<br>1-day click and 1-day engaged-view<br>1-day click and 1-day view<br>1-day click and 1-day engaged-view and 1-day view |
| `CONVERSIONS` | `INCREMENTAL_OFFSITE_<br>CONVERSIONS` | Null click, Null view |

For all other `optimization_goal` and `objective` combinations, you can only use 1-day click for `attribution_spec`.

### Outcome-Driven Ads Experiences Objective Validation {#odax}

**Warning:** From v20.0 onwards, Impressions optimization goal is deprecated for the legacy Post Engagement objective and the `ON_POST` destination_type.

#### Objective values

The following are newer objectives:

* `OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`
* `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`
* `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`
* `OUTCOME_LEADS`
* `OUTCOME_SALES`
* `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`

These newer objectives will eventually replace the original objectives `APP_INSTALLS`, `BRAND_AWARENESS`, `CONVERSIONS`, `EVENT_RESPONSES`, `LEAD_GENERATION`, `LINK_CLICKS`, `LOCAL_AWARENESS`, `MESSAGES`, `OFFER_CLAIMS`, `PAGE_LIKES`, `POST_ENGAGEMENT`, `PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES`, `REACH`, `STORE_VISITS`, `VIDEO_VIEWS`. We will continue supporting these original objectives throughout 2022.

#### Limitations

* Trying to duplicate existing objective campaigns to use the new objective values (`OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`, `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`, `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`, `OUTCOME_LEADS`, `OUTCOME_SALES`, `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`) may throw an error.
