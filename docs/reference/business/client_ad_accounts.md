# Business Client Ad Accounts



## Reading

This business can access all these client-owned ad accounts.

**Warning:** At the end of September 2024, the `POST /{pixel-id}/shared_accounts` API (including previous versions) will not support sharing of pixels with an ad account, if a business account does not have access to both pixel and ad account. Refer to the [pixel sharing API solution](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/business-asset-management/guides/business-pixel-sharing) to use `POST /{pixel-id}/agencies` or use `POST {ad_account}/agencies` to share into a business account, then use `POST /{pixel-id}/shared_accounts` to link pixel and ad account
