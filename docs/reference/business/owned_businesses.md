## Creating

**Note:** To create other Business Managers, your business needs to obtain `BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT` during the [app review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review). If your app is in development mode, you can surpass this requirement, but to create only two child businesses.

### /{business_id}/owned_businesses
You can make a POST request to *owned_businesses* edge from the following paths:

- [/{business_id}/owned_businesses](reference/business/owned_businesses.md)

When posting to this edge, a [Business](reference/business.md) will be created.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `child_business_external_id`<br><br>*string* | (Optional) An external id that allows you to specify a key for your app to identify the child business. You should query for child businesses using this id because the list API is indexed on this field.<br> |
| `name`<br><br>*string* | (Required) Name of entity for displaying.  It should match the public name of your business or organization, since it will be visible across Meta. It can't contain special characters.<br><br>**[required]**<br> |
