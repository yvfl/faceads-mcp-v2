# Business User



In Graph API v9.0, [access to this endpoint was restricted](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version9.0#business). In Graph API v10.0, [access has been restored to all apps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version10.0#business), but apps can now only target businesses (or child businesses of those businesses) that have claimed them.

## Reading

Represents a business user. A business user can be an employee of the business or an admin of the business. An Employee can see all of information in business settings and be assigned roles by business admins. An Admin can control all aspects of the business including modifying or deleting the account and adding or removing people from the employee list
