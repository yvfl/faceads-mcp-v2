# Ad Set



**Warning:** Beginning September 2, 2025, we will start to roll out more proactive restrictions on custom audiences and custom conversions that may suggest information not permitted under [our terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools?_rdr). For example, any custom audience or custom conversions suggesting specific health conditions (e.g., "arthritis", "diabetes") or financial status (e.g., "credit score", "high income") will be flagged and prevented from being used to run ad campaigns.

**What these restrictions mean for your campaigns:**

* You won’t be able to use flagged custom audiences or custom conversions when creating new campaigns.
* If you have an active campaign using flagged custom audiences or custom conversions, you should promptly review and resolve the issues by following the resolution steps to avoid delivery and performance issues.

**For API developers:**

* Starting September 2, 2025, if an ad set contains one or more flagged custom audiences and custom conversions, the [`issues_info` list](reference/ad-campaign.md#Reading) will be populated with one issue per flagged items.
* Creation and editing of ad sets that contain flagged custom audiences and custom conversions will not be blocked, but campaign delivery and performance may be impacted unless the flags are resolved.

More information on this update and how to resolve flagged custom audiences can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1055828013359808), while information for resolving flagged custom conversions is available [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2455915321411996).

An ad set is a group of ads that share the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, bid type, bid info, and targeting data. Ad sets enable you to group ads according to your criteria, and you can retrieve the ad-related statistics that apply to a set. See [Optimized CPM](bidding/guides/cost-per-action-ads.md) and [Promoted Object](reference/ad-promoted-object.md).

For example, create an ad set with a daily budget:

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="My Reach Ad Set"' \
  -F 'optimization_goal="REACH"' \
  -F 'billing_event="IMPRESSIONS"' \
  -F 'bid_amount=2' \
  -F 'daily_budget=1000' \
  -F 'campaign_id="<AD_CAMPAIGN_ID>"' \
  -F 'targeting={
       "geo_locations": {
         "countries": [
           "US"
         ]
       },
       "facebook_positions": [
         "feed"
       ]
     }' \
  -F 'status="PAUSED"' \
  -F 'promoted_object={
       "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>"
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets
```

Create an ad set with a lifetime budget

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="My First Adset"' \
  -F 'lifetime_budget=20000' \
  -F 'start_time="2025-12-04T20:32:30-0800"' \
  -F 'end_time="2025-12-14T20:32:30-0800"' \
  -F 'campaign_id="<AD_CAMPAIGN_ID>"' \
  -F 'bid_amount=100' \
  -F 'billing_event="LINK_CLICKS"' \
  -F 'optimization_goal="LINK_CLICKS"' \
  -F 'targeting={
       "facebook_positions": [
         "feed"
       ],
       "geo_locations": {
         "countries": [
           "US"
         ]
       },
       "publisher_platforms": [
         "facebook",
         "audience_network"
       ]
     }' \
  -F 'status="PAUSED"' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets
```

### Limits {#limits}

The following are the limits on ad sets

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum number of ad sets per regular ad account | 5000 non-deleted ad sets |
| Maximum number of ad sets per bulk ad account | 10000 non-deleted ad sets |
| Maximum number of ads per ad set | 50 non-archived ads |

### Housing, Employment and Credit Ads

Facebook is committed to protecting people from discrimination, and we are continually improving our ability to detect and deter potential abuse. It’s already against [our policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/discriminatory_practices) to discriminate by wrongfully targeting or excluding specific groups of people. As part of a [historic settlement agreement](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-against-discrimination-in-ads/), we are making changes to the way we manage housing, employment and credit ads.

Advertisers must specify a `special_ad_category` for ad campaigns that market housing, employment, and credit. In doing so, the set of targeting options available for ads in these campaigns will be restricted. See [Special Ad Category](audiences/special-ad-category.md) for more information.

### Flagged custom conversions, custom audiences and/or lookalike audiences

If an ad set contains one or more custom lookalike audiences flagged with an `operation_status` of `471`, the `issues_info` list will be populated with one issue per flagged audience as warning.

**Example**

```html
{
  "effective_status": "ACTIVE",
  "issues_info": [
    {
      "level": "AD_SET",
      "error_code": 2460003,
      "error_summary": "Custom Audience is blocked",
      "error_message": "Custom Audience is blocked: Some of this ad set’s custom audiences and/or lookalikes are blocked because they suggest the use of information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. Go to Audience Manager for more details, and you can either review each custom audience or lookalike and remove prohibited information, or choose a different one for your ad set or create a new one and make sure it does not include potentially prohibited information. You can also request a review in Audience Manager if you think any don’t use restricted information.",
      "error_type": "SOFT_ERROR",
      "additional_info": "Custom Audience ID: 120231141155310247"
    },
    {
      "level": "AD_SET",
      "error_code": 2460003,
      "error_summary": "Custom Audience is blocked",
      "error_message": "Custom Audience is blocked: Some of this ad set’s custom audiences and/or lookalikes are blocked because they suggest the use of information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. Go to Audience Manager for more details, and you can either review each custom audience or lookalike and remove prohibited information, or choose a different one for your ad set or create a new one and make sure it does not include potentially prohibited information.

      "error_type": "SOFT_ERROR",
      "additional_info": "Custom Audience ID: 120232742978230247"
    },
    {
      "level": "AD_SET",
      "error_code": 2460004,
      "error_summary": "Custom Conversion is blocked",
      "error_message": "Custom Conversion is blocked: This ad set’s custom conversion is blocked because it suggests the use of information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. You can’t edit this custom conversion, but you can choose a different one for this ad set or create a new one that doesn’t use prohibited information. You can also request a review if you think your custom conversion doesn’t use prohibited information.",
      "error_type": "SOFT_ERROR",

    }
  ],
  "id": "120228591637010247"
}
```

In addition, attempting to create or modify ad sets containing any flagged custom audience, lookalike audience or custom conversion will fail with an error. The error will contain the list of IDs for the restricted assets.

##### For flagged custom audiences

```json
{
  "error": {
    "error_subcode": 246003,
    "error_data": {
      "Restricted Custom Audience IDs": [
        "<CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID1>",
        "<CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID2>"
      ]
    }
    "error_user_title": "Your custom audience is currently blocked",
    "error_user_msg": "  This custom audience is blocked because it may contain information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. Visit the audience manager to appeal this decision, edit your audience and remove prohibited information, or choose a different audience."
  },
}
```

##### For flagged custom conversions

```json
{
  "error": {
    "error_subcode": 246004,
    "error_data": {
      "Restricted Custom Conversion ID": "<CUSTOM_CONVERSION_ID>"
    }
    "error_user_title": "Your custom conversion is currently blocked",
    "error_user_msg": "This custom conversion is blocked because it may contain information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. Visit the events manager to appeal this decision, edit your custom conversion and remove prohibited information, or choose a different custom conversion."
  },
}
```

#### To resolve flagged audiences

If your custom or lookalike audiences are flagged, consider these options.

To resolve flagged custom audiences:

* **Review flagged audiences**: Use Audience Manager to review your custom audience along with other information included in an audience, and remove any information that is not allowed under edit the audience to comply with [Meta's terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/).
* **Create new or choose different audiences**: Alternatively, you can create a new custom audience or choose a different existing custom audience and make sure that it does not include information not allowed under our terms and use that to run campaigns.

To resolve flagged lookalike audiences:

* **Resolve issues with the underlying custom audience**: If the underlying custom audience (also known as the seed audience) of your lookalike audience is flagged, you will need to resolve the issue with the underlying custom audience on which the lookalike audience is built. Please refer to the preceding section on how to resolve flagged custom audiences.
* **Create new audiences**: Consider developing new lookalike audiences and make sure that they don't include information that is not allowed under our terms.

##### Request a review

If you believe your custom audience or lookalike audience has been flagged in error and doesn't include non-permitted information, you can request a review via Ads Manager under the campaigns table or, or in Audience Manager by clicking on individual audiences and under the summary tab of the impacted audience.

#### To resolve flagged custom conversions

If any of your custom conversions are flagged for suggesting information that is not allowed under our terms, you may want to consider the following options.

To resolve a flagged custom conversion in a new campaign creation:

* **Create new custom conversion**: Use a new custom conversion and make sure that it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms.
* **Choose a different custom conversion**: Select a different existing custom conversion and make sure it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms.

To resolve a flagged custom conversion in an existing campaign:

* **Duplicate your campaign and select an existing custom conversion**: If you have a running campaign that is flagged due to a flagged custom conversion, consider duplicating the campaign and selecting a different custom conversion that is not flagged before publishing the new duplicated campaign. **Note:** Once the campaign is published, you cannot remove or select a different custom conversion.

##### Request a review

If you believe your custom conversion has been flagged in error and doesn't include non-permitted information, you can request a review via Ads Manager under the campaigns table, or in Events Manager under the custom conversions page.

### Targeting European Union Ads

Beginning Tuesday, May 16, 2023 advertisers who include the European Union (EU), associated territories, or select global/worldwide in their ad targeting on Facebook and Instagram will be asked to include information about who benefits from the ad (the beneficiary) and who is paying for the ad (the payor) for each ad set. Advertisers will be prompted for this information in all ads buying surfaces including Ads Manager and the Marketing API. Beginning Wednesday, August 16, 2023, if beneficiary and payer information is not provided, the ad will not be published.

We are launching this requirement to respond to the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) which goes into full effect for Facebook and Instagram later this year.

Ad sets targeted to the EU and/or associated territories (see [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/605021638170961/) for a complete list) are required to provide beneficiary information (who benefits from the ad running), and payer information (who pays for the ad). This applies to new ads, duplicated ads, or significantly edited ads from May 16 forward, and without the required information, the API will respond with a wrong parameter error. For convenience the advertiser can set a saved beneficiary and payor in their ad account, which will be auto-populated during ad set creation, copying, and updating targets to include EU locations and ads under existing ad seta without configured the payor and beneficiary.. For more information about the ad account level parameters, `default_dsa_payor` and `default_dsa_beneficiary`, see to the check the [Ad Account reference document](reference/ad-account.md).

To facilitate the creation of ad sets targeting the EU, we're offering a new API which allows developers to get a list of likely beneficiary/payer strings, based on ad account activity. See [Ad Account DSA Recommendations](reference/ad-account/dsa_recommendations.md) for more information.

**Notice:**

* When the default values are set in the ad account, during ad set creation, updating, and ad creation under an existing ad set, if one of them is not provided, the API will automatically fill the default value listed in the ad account. **Do not pass only one of them and expect the API to set the other one to be the same value.** For example, in the ad account settings, `default_dsa_payor` is `payor_default` and `default_dsa_beneficiary` is `beneficiary_default`. During ad set creation, if only `dsa_payor` is passed with the payor, the `dsa_beneficiary` will be automatically filled with value of `beneficiary_default` instead of `dsa_payor`.
* If no saved default values are set or the values are unset, without explicitly passing the payor or beneficiary during ad set creation or when making updates, it will trigger an error and the request will fail.
* The `payer` and the `beneficiary` fields are only for ad sets targeting the EU and/or associated territories.
* For ad sets targeting regions other than the EU and/or associated territories, that information will not be saved even if it is provided.

To facilitate the creation of ad sets targeting the EU, we're offering a new API which allows developers to get a list of likely beneficiary/payer strings, based on ad account activity. See [Ad Account Dsa Recommendations](reference/ad-account/dsa_recommendations.md) for more information.

## Reading

An ad set is a group of ads that share the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, bid type, bid info, and targeting data. Ad sets enable you to group ads according to your criteria, and you can retrieve the ad-related statistics that apply to a set.

**Warning:** The `date_preset = lifetime` parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with `date_preset = maximum`, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, `date_preset = maximum` will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any `lifetime` calls will default to `maximum` and return only 37 months of data.

### Examples {#read-examples}

```html
curl -X GET \
  -d 'fields="name,status"' \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_SET_ID>/
```

To retrieve date-time related fields in a UNIX timestamp format, use the `date_format` parameter:

```html
curl -X GET \
  -d 'fields="id,name,start_time,end_time"' \
  -d 'date_format="U"' \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_SET_ID>/
```

This strategy is also known as *automatic bidding*.<br>Learn more in [Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/721453268045071).<br><br>`LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP`: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on<br>your ad set `optimization_goal` while limiting actual bid to your specified<br>amount. With a bid cap you have more control over your<br>cost per actual optimization event. However if you set a limit which is too low you may<br>get less ads delivery. Get your bid cap with the field `bid_amount`.<br>This strategy is also known as *manual maximum-cost bidding*.<br>Learn more in [Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/721453268045071).<br><br>Notes:<br><br><br>• If you enable campaign budget optimization, you should get `bid_strategy` at the parent campaign level.<br>• `TARGET_COST` bidding strategy has been deprecated with [Marketing API v9](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version9.0).<br> |

## Creating

**Warning:** For v20.0+, the Impressions optimization goal is deprecated for the legacy Post Engagement objective and the `ON_POST` destination_type.

### Examples {#create-examples}

Validate an ad set with a daily budget where the campaign objective is set to `APP_INSTALLS`.

### Considerations {#create-considerations}

#### Bid/Budget Validations

**Note:**

- All values in this section are in US Dollars.

- Differenct currencies have different minimum daily budget limits.

- Minimum values are defined in terms of the daily budget but apply to lifetime budgets as well.

- Minimum budget takes the total spent budget into account.

When creating an ad set, there will be a minimum budget for different billing events (Clicks, Impressions, Actions).  If the minimum daily budget is $5, a campaign lasting 5 days will need at least $25 for budget.

**Warning:** Budget amounts shown are for illustrative purposes only and can change based on situation.

If `bid_strategy` is set to `LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP` in the ad set:

| Billing Event | Minimum Daily Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Impressions | $0.50 |
| Clicks/Likes/Video Views | $2.50 |
| Low-frequency Actions  <br>(Includes mobile app installs, offer claims, or canvas app installs) | $40  <br>**Important:** This minimum daily budget is the same for all countries. |

If `bid_strategy` is set to `LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP` in the ad set:

| Billing Event | Minimum Daily Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Impressions | At least the `bid_amount`. For example, if the bid amount is $10, then $10 will be the minimum budget required. |
| Clicks/Actions | 5x the `bid_amount` for a Click or Action. For example, if the bid amount is $5 per click/action, then $25 will be the minimum budget required. |

**Note:** Budgets in non-USD currencies will be converted and validated upon time of ad set creation.

**Note:** For ads belonging to ad accounts from countries in the list below, the minimum values are 2x the ones in the tables. For example, if the billing event is an Impression, the minimum daily budget is $0.50, but in the the following countries the minimum would be $1.00:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States of America.

The only exception to this rule are Low-Frequency Actions when `bid_strategy` is `LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP`.

#### Locale targeted page post

If you promote a Page post which has been targeted by locale the ad set targeting must include the same, or a subset of, locale targeting as the Page post.

E.g. if the Page post is targeted at locales 6 (US English) and 24 (UK English), then the ad set must be targeted at one or more of the same locales.

#### Mobile App Ads

Mobile app ad sets should

- be used in conjunction with [targeting spec](audiences/reference/advanced-targeting.md#mobile) fields `user_device` and `user_os`

- have a `MOBILE_APP_*` objective on the [campaign](reference/ad-campaign-group.md)

#### Desktop App Ads

Desktop app ad sets must

- include a [targeting spec](audiences/reference/advanced-targeting.md) of either

- `'page_types':['desktopfeed']` or

- `'page_types':['rightcolumn']` or

- `'page_types':['desktop']` along with the other targeting options you have selected.

- include a `CANVAS_APP_*` objective

#### Lookalike Expansion

Beginning with v13.0, for newly created ad sets that optimize for value, conversions, or app events, lookalike expansion will be turned on by default and cannot be disabled. When getting an ad set that optimizes for value, conversions, or app events, we will return a new lookalike property in the `targeting_optimization_types` map that indicates lookalike expansion is enabled and complements the existing `detailed_targeting` property for the detailed targeting expansion.

#### Targeting DSA Regulated Locations (EU)

For ad sets targeting the EU and/or associated territories, the `dsa_payor` and `dsa_beneficiary` fields are required. The information provided in these 2 fields  will be shown to end users to indicate who is paying for the ad and who is the beneficiary of the ad.

**Request**

Include the following fields in an API call to the `/{adset_id}` endpoint.

```
{
  "dsa_payor": "<PAYOR_NAME>",
  "dsa_beneficiary": "<BENEFICIARY_NAME>"
  ...
}
```

**Fields**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dsa_payor`<br><br>string (max 512 char) | The payor of all ads in this ad set. |
| `dsa_beneficiary`<br><br>string (max 512 char) | The beneficiary of all ads in this ad set. |

If these fields are not provided, the API may returns the following errors:

**Payor missing error**

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `adlabels`<br><br>*list<Object>* | Specifies list of labels to be associated with this object. This field is optional<br> |
| `adset_schedule`<br><br>*list<Object>* | Ad set schedule, representing a delivery schedule for a single day<br><br><br>`start_minute` *int64*<br>A 0 based minute of the day representing when the schedule starts<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`end_minute` *int64*<br>A 0 based minute of the day representing when the schedule ends<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`days` *list<int64>*<br>Array of ints representing which days the schedule is active. Valid values are 0-6 with 0 representing Sunday, 1 representing Monday, ... and 6 representing Saturday.<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`timezone_type` *enum {USER, ADVERTISER}*<br><br>**Default value: **`USER` |
| `attribution_spec`<br><br>*list<JSON object>* | Conversion attribution spec used for attributing conversions for optimization. Supported window lengths differ by optimization goal and campaign objective.<br><br><br>`event_type` *enum {CLICK_THROUGH, VIEW_THROUGH, ENGAGED_VIDEO_VIEW}*<br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`window_days` *int64*<br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`weight` *float*<br><br>**Default value: **`100` |
| `automatic_manual_state`<br><br>*enum{UNSET, AUTOMATIC, MANUAL}* | automatic_manual_state<br> |
| `bid_amount`<br><br>*integer* | Bid cap or target cost for this ad set. The bid cap used in a *lowest cost bid strategy* is defined as the maximum bid you want to pay for a result based on your `optimization_goal`. The target cost used in a *target cost bid strategy* lets Facebook bid to meet your target on average and keep costs stable as you spend. If an ad level `bid_amount` is specified, updating this value will overwrite the previous ad level bid. Unless you are using [Reach and Frequency](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reachandfrequency), `bid_amount` is required if `bid_strategy` is set to `LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP` or `COST_CAP`.<br><br>The bid amount's unit is cents for currencies like USD, EUR, and the basic unit for currencies like JPY, KRW. The bid amount for ads with `IMPRESSION` or `REACH` as `billing_event` is per 1,000 occurrences, and has to be at least 2 US cents or more. For ads with other `billing_event`s, the bid amount is for each occurrence, and has a minimum value 1 US cents. The minimum bid amounts of other currencies are of similar value to the US Dollar values provided.<br> |
| `bid_strategy` This field is only accessible in v3.0 or later.<br><br>*enum{LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP, COST_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS}* | Choose bid strategy for this ad set to suit your specific business goals.<br>Each strategy has tradeoffs and may be available for certain `optimization_goal`s:<br><br>`LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP`: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on<br>your ad set `optimization_goal` without limiting your bid amount. This is the best strategy<br>if you care most about cost efficiency. However with this strategy it may be harder to get<br>stable average costs as you spend. This strategy is also known as *automatic bidding*.<br>Learn more in [Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/721453268045071).<br><br>`LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP`: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on<br>your ad set `optimization_goal` while limiting actual bid to your specified<br>amount. With a bid cap you have more control over your<br>cost per actual optimization event. However if you set a limit which is too low you may<br>get less ads delivery. If you select this, you must provide<br>a bid cap with the `bid_amount` field.<br>Note: during creation this bid strategy is set if you provide `bid_amount` only.<br>This strategy is also known as *manual maximum-cost bidding*.<br>Learn more in [Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/721453268045071).<br><br><br>Notes:<br><br><br>• If you enable campaign budget optimization, you should set `bid_strategy` at the parent campaign level.<br><br>• `TARGET_COST` bidding strategy has been deprecated with [Marketing API v9](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version9.0).<br><br> |

## Updating

### Examples {#update-examples}

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'billing_event="IMPRESSIONS"' \
  -F 'optimization_goal="LINK_CLICKS"' \
  -F 'bid_amount=200' \
  -F 'targeting={
       "geo_locations": {
         "countries": [
           "US"
         ]
       },
       "facebook_positions": [
         "feed"
       ]
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_SET_ID>/
```

To update the `end_time` of an ad set, using ISO-8601 date-time format

### PHP Business SDK
```
use FacebookAds\Object\AdSet;

$adset = new AdSet('<AD_SET_ID>');
$adset->end_time = '2013-10-02T00:00:00-0700';
$adset->update();
```

### Python Business SDK
```
from facebookads.objects import AdSet

adset = AdSet('<AD_SET_ID>')
adset[AdSet.Field.end_time] = '2013-10-02T00:00:00-0700'
adset.remote_update()
```

### cURL
```
curl \
-F "end_time=2013-10-02T00:00:00-0700" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<AD_SET_ID>"
```

To update the status of an ad set to paused

### PHP Business SDK
```
use FacebookAds\Object\AdSet;

$adset = new AdSet('<AD_SET_ID>');
$adset->campaign_status = AdSet::STATUS_PAUSED;
$adset->update();
```

### Python Business SDK
```
from facebookads.objects import AdSet

adset = AdSet('<AD_SET_ID>')
adset[AdSet.Field.status] = AdSet.Status.paused
adset.remote_update()
```

### cURL
```
curl \
-F "campaign_status=PAUSED" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<AD_SET_ID>"
```

### Remarks

An archived ad set can only update two fields: `name` and `campaign_status`. The `campaign_status` field can only be changed to `DELETED`.

A deleted ad set can only change its `name`.

There are two considerations to take into account when adjusting an ad set's budget value or budget type:

- When updating a set's lifetime or daily budget to a lower value, the new value must be at least 10% greater than the current amount spent already. For example: if an ad set has a $1000 lifetime budget and has spend $300 so far, the lowest new lifetime budget would be $330.

- Since `v2.4`, ad sets have a minimum required budget. Any update must take that into consideration. Check the details at the [Create Considerations](#create-considerations) section from this page.

**Note:** When using the Reservation buying type, some fields may not be available to be updated through the API.

You can't perform this operation on this endpoint.

## Deleting

### Examples {#delete-examples}

```html
curl -X DELETE \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_SET_ID>/
```

### /{ad_set_id}
You can delete an [AdSet](reference/ad-campaign.md) by making a DELETE request to [/{ad_set_id}](reference/ad-campaign.md).

    new GraphRequest.Callback() {
        public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
            /* handle the result */
        }
    }
).executeAsync();
```

### iOS SDK
```
/* make the API call */
FBSDKGraphRequest *request = [[FBSDKGraphRequest alloc]
                               initWithGraphPath:@"/<AD_SET_ID>/"
                                      parameters:params
                                      HTTPMethod:@"DELETE"];
[request startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBSDKGraphRequestConnection *connection,
                                      id result,
                                      NSError *error) {
