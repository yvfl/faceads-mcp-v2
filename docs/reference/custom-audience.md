# Custom Audience



**Warning:** Beginning September 2, 2025, we will start to roll out more proactive restrictions on custom audiences that may suggest information not permitted under our terms. For example, any custom audience or lookalike audience suggesting specific health conditions (e.g., "arthritis", "diabetes") or financial status (e.g., "credit score", "high income") will be flagged and prevented from being used to run ad campaigns.

**What these restrictions mean for your campaigns:**

* You won't be able to use flagged custom audiences when creating new campaigns.
* If you have an active campaign using flagged custom audiences, you should edit or pause it and choose a different audience to avoid performance and delivery issues.

**For API developers:**

* Beginning September 2, 2025, `operation_statu`s will return `471` to signal if your custom audiences have been flagged.

More information on this update and how to resolve flagged custom audiences can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1055828013359808).

Build an audience of your customers, website visitors, mobile app visitors or people similar to them. To add or remove users from a custom audience, see the [Custom Audience User reference](reference/custom-audience/users.md).

To use custom audiences, business users must first sign our [Terms Of Service](audiences/reference/custom-audience-terms-of-service.md).

To improve how audiences are created and managed, custom audiences that have not been used in any active ad sets in over two years will be deleted on a rolling basis automatically. See the [Custom Audiences: Overview: Deletion](audiences/overview.md#custom-audiences-deletion) for more information.

### Flagged custom and lookalike audiences {#flagged}

If one or more custom or lookalike audience is flagged with an `operation_status` of `471`, the `effective_status` field of the ad set will change to `WITH_ISSUES` and the `issues_info` list will be populated with one issue per flagged audience. The `fields_violating_integrity_policy` field will be populated with the list of flagged fields.

Attempting to edit a flagged custom audience without changing the custom audience fields listed in the `fields_violating_integrity_policy` field will result in an error.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid parameter",
    "code": 100,
    "error_subcode": 1713231,
    "error_user_title": "Update Restricted Fields and Rule",
    "error_user_msg": "This custom audience has integrity restrictions. To continue, you must update the restricted fields and the rule in your current edit",
  },
}
```

Attempting to edit a flagged lookalike audience or customer file custom audience (DFCA) will result in an error.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid parameter",
    "code": 100,
    "error_subcode": 1713228,
    "error_user_title": "Custom Audience Cannot Be Edited",
    "error_user_msg": "This audience cannot be edited due to integrity restrictions. Please appeal the restrictions or create a new audience",
  },
}
```

**Example**

```html
{
"account_id": "<OWNER_ACCOUNT_ID>",
"approximate_count": 5000,
"approximate_count_lower_bound": 4900,
"approximate_count_upper_bound": 5100,

}
```

#### To resolve flagged audiences

If your custom or lookalike audiences are flagged, consider these options.

To resolve flagged custom audiences:

* **Review flagged audiences**: Use Audience Manager to review your custom audience along with other information included in an audience, and remove any information that is not allowed under [Meta's terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/).
* **Create new or choose different audiences**: Alternatively, you can create a new custom audience or choose a different existing custom audience and make sure that it does not include information not allowed under our terms and use that to run campaigns.

To resolve flagged lookalike audiences:

* **Resolve issues with the underlying custom audience**: If the underlying custom audience (also known as the seed audience) of your lookalike audience is flagged, you will need to resolve the issue with the underlying custom audience on which the lookalike audience is built. Please refer to the preceding section on how to resolve flagged custom audiences.
* **Create new audiences**: Consider developing new lookalike audiences and make sure that they don't include information that is not allowed under our terms.

##### Request a review

If you believe your custom audience or lookalike audience has been flagged in error and doesn't include non-permitted information, you can request a review via Ads Manager under the campaigns table or, or in Audience Manager by clicking on individual audiences and under the summary tab of the impacted audience.

## Reading

Custom audiences are designed to provide advertisers the ability to target their ads to a specific set of people with whom they have already established a relationship on and off Facebook. Advertisers may choose to define audiences by email address, Facebook User IDs, phone numbers, names, date of birth, gender, locations, [app user IDs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/targeting/mobile-advertiser-ids), Apple's Advertising Identifier (IDFA), [Android's advertising ID](https://developers.google.com/ads/#apps) or by a combination of rules used to identify users who took specific actions on their website.  

When utilizing Facebook User IDs please ensure you comply with [Facebook Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms) and [Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/devpolicy). You must accept the [Custom Audience Terms of Service](audiences/reference/custom-audience-terms-of-service.md) in order to use custom audiences. You can query which terms have been accepted by checking the `tos_accepted` field of a given ad account. See [Ad Account](reference/ad-account.md) for more information.

## Creating

### Limitations

* The `subtype` field for engagement custom audiences is only supported for video.
* Mobile app custom audiences for inclusion targeting is no longer supported for the `POST /{ad-account-id}/adsets` endpoint for iOS 14+ SKAdNetwork campaigns.
* New iOS 14+ app install campaigns will no longer be able to use app connections targeting.

### Examples

Create a blank audience:

```html
curl \
-F 'name="My new CA"' \
-F 'subtype=CUSTOM' \
-F 'description="People who bought from my website"' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customaudiences
```

You can't perform this operation on this endpoint.

## Updating

If a person opted out of being targeted, you must remove them from all custom audiences in which they appear. To opt-out a person from an audience after they have clicked through to your opt-out URL, make an `HTTP DELETE` call to:

```html
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/usersofanyaudience
```

Provide the same fields as you do in a [user update](reference/custom-audience/users.md). This will remove the people you specify from **ALL** custom file custom audiences belonging to the specified ad account.

### Examples

To update the audience name:

```html
curl \
-F 'name=Updated Name for CA' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID>
```

To edit an opt-out link:

```html
curl \
-F 'opt_out_link=http://www.yourdomain.com/optout' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<CUSTOM_AUDIENCE_ID>
```

### /{custom_audience_id}
You can update a [CustomAudience](reference/custom-audience.md) by making a POST request to [/{custom_audience_id}](reference/custom-audience.md).
