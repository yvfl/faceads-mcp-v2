## Filter Rules

Creating a product set with an empty `filter` parameter indicates that all items in the product catalog should be in the set. Each rule is a JSON-encoded string. An empty `filter` parameter can be specified using either an empty parameter value or an empty JSON object, `{}`.

**Recommendation:** Query with content type `application/json`.  

### Limitations

* If the filter rules you set result in an empty product set, ads tied to this product set will not deliver.
* The `contains` operators can only be used for string matching when creating product sets. For `enum` values use the `eq` operators.
* Filter operators are not case sensitive. However, `i_*` operators can still be used.
* You can't use non-English Unicode characters for filters in labels.

**Warning:** For a full list of limitations and examples, along with useful tips about how to use punctuation characters to create and manage product sets,  [see this Business Help Center article](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/741923962861190)

### Operators

**Warning:** [Starting March 3, 2022](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/non-versioned-changes/mar-3-2022), we changed how certain filters work for product sets. These include the `contains`, `not_contains`, `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`, and `starts_with` filters. You have 90 days to update your filters. If any sets in your catalog are using the affected filters after June 1, 2022, the items in those sets may change. This means that different items could display in your ads or shops that use those sets. See [the changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/non-versioned-changes/mar-3-2022) for more details.

| Operator | Type of filter |
| --- | --- |
| `and` | Returns products that match all query values inclusively. For example, `"color": {"red" and "shoe" and "running"}` will only return products that match all 3 query values, such as "red running shoe". |
| `contains` | Returns products that match a query string. For example, `category: {"contains": "running shoe"}` will return all products that contain the query string, such as "red running shoe", "blue running shoe", and "running shoe for kids". |
| `or` | Returns products that match only one query value exclusively. For example, `category: {"running" or "walking"}` will return products that match "running" or "walking" but not both. |
| `not_contains` | Returns products that do not match a query string. For example, `category: {"not_contains": running shoe"}` will return all products that do not contain the query string, such as "red walking shoe", "sandals", and "boots". |
| `is_any` | Returns products that match any value in a list of query values. For example, `"color": {"is_any": "black", "blue", "brown"}` will return any product that matches at least one query string, such as "black boots", "blue boots", "brown boots". |
| `is_not_any` | Returns products that do not match any value in a list of query strings. For example, `"color": {"is_not_any": "black", "blue", "brown"}` will return any products that do not match any of the query values, such as "red boots", "yellow boots", and "green boots". |
| `eq` | Returns products that exactly match a query value. For example, `"brand": {"eq": "Instagram"}` will only match "Instagram" brand products. |
| `neq` | Returns products that do not exactly match a query value. For example, `"brand": {"eq": "Instagram"}` will only match products that are not "Instagram" brand products. |
| `lt`<br><br>int | Returns products that are less than a numeric query value. For example, `"priority": {"lt": 3}` will only match products with a priority that is less than 3. |
| `lte`<br><br>int | Returns products that are less than or equal to a numeric query value. For example, `"priority": {"lte": 3}` will only match products with a priority that is less than or equal to 3. |
| `gt`<br><br>int | Returns products that are greater than a numeric query value. For example, `"priority": {"gt": 3}` will only match products with a priority that is greater than 3. |
| `gte`<br><br>int | Returns products that are greater than or equal to a numeric query value. For example, `"priority": {"gte": 3}` will only match products with a priority that is greater than or equal to 3. |
| `starts_with` | Returns products that match any string that starts with the query string. For example, `"small"` will return any product that starts with the query string, such as "small sandals", "small t-shirt", "small, blue boots". **Note**: This filter option is now only available for the product category field. For other fields, you should use the `contains` filter. |

### Filter Examples

*Formatted for readability.*

To create a product set that matches specific product IDs, send a `POST` request to the `/PRODUCT-CATALOG-ID/product_sets` endpoint and set the `retailer_id` filter field to `is_any` operator and an array of product IDs.

`curl -i -X POST`

`"https://graph.facebook.com/API-VERSION/PRODUCT-CATALOG-ID/product_sets
`

`?name=Sample Product Set`

`&filter={`

`'retailer_id': {`

`'is_any': ['pid1', 'pid2']`

`}`

`}`

`&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"`

To create a product set that matches all shirt items, send a `POST` request to the `/PRODUCT-CATALOG-ID/product_sets` endpoint and set the `product_type` filter field to `i_contains` operator and the string `shirt`.

`curl -i - X POST `

`"https://graph.facebook.com/API-VERSION/PRODUCT-CATALOG-ID/product_sets`

`&name=New Product Set Name`

`&filter={`

`'product_type': {`

`'i_contains': 'shirt'`

`}`

`}`

`&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"`

Each rule is a JSON-encoded string.

**Recommendation:** Query with content type `application/json`.
