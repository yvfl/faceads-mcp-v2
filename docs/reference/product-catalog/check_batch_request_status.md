# Product Catalog Check Batch Request Status



This is a Graph API [edge](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview#edges) that returns the status of a single Batch API request. Hence the resulting collection always contains a single element - the status.

## Reading

Retrieve status of the request

#### Example

### HTTP
```
GET /v25.0/{product-catalog-id}/check_batch_request_status HTTP/1.1
Host: graph.facebook.com
```

### PHP SDK
```
/* PHP SDK v5.0.0 */
/* make the API call */
try {
  // Returns a `Facebook\FacebookResponse` object
  $response = $fb->get(
    '/{product-catalog-id}/check_batch_request_status',
    '{access-token}'
  );
} catch(Facebook\Exceptions\FacebookResponseException $e) {
  echo 'Graph returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
} catch(Facebook\Exceptions\FacebookSDKException $e) {
  echo 'Facebook SDK returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
$graphNode = $response->getGraphNode();
/* handle the result */
```

### JavaScript SDK
```
/* make the API call */
FB.api(
    "/{product-catalog-id}/check_batch_request_status",
    function (response) {
      if (response && !response.error) {
        /* handle the result */
      }
    }
);
```

### Android SDK
```
/* make the API call */
new GraphRequest(
    AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken(),
    "/{product-catalog-id}/check_batch_request_status",
    null,
    HttpMethod.GET,
    new GraphRequest.Callback() {
        public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
            /* handle the result */
        }
    }
).executeAsync();
```

### iOS SDK
```
/* make the API call */
FBSDKGraphRequest *request = [[FBSDKGraphRequest alloc]
                               initWithGraphPath:@"/{product-catalog-id}/check_batch_request_status"
                                      parameters:params
                                      HTTPMethod:@"GET"];
[request startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBSDKGraphRequestConnection *connection,
                                      id result,
                                      NSError *error) {
    // Handle the result
}];
```

| `load_ids_of_invalid_requests`<br><br>*boolean* | **Default value: **`false`<br>Whether the ‘ids_of_invalid_requests’ field needs to be populated.
