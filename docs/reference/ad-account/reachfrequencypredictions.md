# Ad Account Reach and Frequency Prediction



**Warning:** Beginning with v23.0, the `instagram_destination_id` field will return the `ig_user_id` rather than the `instagram_actor_id`. The `instagram_actor_id` is also no longer supported in the `destination_ids` parameter; update your API calls to use the `ig_user_id` instead.

## Reading

Reach frequency predictions for the ad account.

  $response = $fb->get(
    '/{ad-account-id}/reachfrequencypredictions',
    '{access-token}'
  );
} catch(Facebook\Exceptions\FacebookResponseException $e) {
  echo 'Graph returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
} catch(Facebook\Exceptions\FacebookSDKException $e) {

}
$graphNode = $response->getGraphNode();
/* handle the result */
```

### JavaScript SDK
```
/* make the API call */
FB.api(
    "/{ad-account-id}/reachfrequencypredictions",
    function (response) {
      if (response && !response.error) {
        /* handle the result */
      }
    }
);
```

### Android SDK
```
/* make the API call */
new GraphRequest(
    AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken(),
    "/{ad-account-id}/reachfrequencypredictions",
    null,
    HttpMethod.GET,
    new GraphRequest.Callback() {
        public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
            /* handle the result */
        }
    }
).executeAsync();
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `budget`<br><br>*int64* | Expected lifetime budget in cents in the currency for the ad account. Must be greater than the default budget limit.<br> |
| `campaign_group_id`<br><br>*numeric string or integer* | The ID of the campaign which this prediction belongs to.<br> |
| `day_parting_schedule`<br><br>*list<Object>* | Ad set schedule, representing a delivery schedule for a single day<br><br>Example:<br>`[{"start_minute":360,"end_minute":1440,"days":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]}]`<br><br> The day part should be same for all week days. There needs to be at least 3 hours of delivery each day.<br><br><br>`start_minute` *int64*<br>A 0 based minute of the day representing when the schedule starts<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`end_minute` *int64*<br>A 0 based minute of the day representing when the schedule ends<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`days` *list<int64>*<br>Array of ints representing which days the schedule is active. Valid values are 0-6 with 0 representing Sunday, 1 representing Monday, ... and 6 representing Saturday.<br><br>**[required]**<br><br><br>`timezone_type` *enum {USER, ADVERTISER}*<br><br>**Default value: **`USER` |
| `deal_id`<br><br>*numeric string or integer* | The ID of the deal which this prediction belongs to.<br> |
| `destination_id`<br><br>*int64* | The ID of the Page or the ID of the app which the ad promotes.<br><br><br>Using the correct advertiser Page or app ID makes your predictions more accurate. Reach and cost predictions for feed are specific to a given ID. They take into account other ads running from the same Page, as well as the past creative quality of ads from the Page, which impacts cost.<br><br><br>If the ad set has `desktopfeed` or `mobilefeed` placement, specify `destination_id` or pass app or Page ID in `destination_ids` field. We recommend using  `destination_ids`.<br> |
| `destination_ids`<br><br>*list<numeric string or integer>* | Array of ID's of the Facebook Page or App which the ad promotes. Also include the Instagram account ID if `instagramstream` placement is used.<br><br><br>If the `objective` is `MOBILE_APP_INSTALLS`, provide only the app ID.

| `end_time`<br><br>*int64* | Same as `stop_time`.<br> |
| `frequency_cap`<br><br>*int64* | If `interval_frequency_cap_reset_period` is specified, this field represents the frequency cap to be set for a custom period. For example: show ad 3 times per user every 48 hours.<br><br><br>However when you read the values back, this represents the lifetime frequency cap for the campaign duration. A separate read-only field called `interval_frequency_cap` provides the frequency cap value originally set for the custom period.<br><br><br>If `interval_frequency_cap_reset_period` is not specified, this field represents the lifetime frequency cap set for the campaign duration.<br><br><br>Target Frequency equivalent is `target_frequency`. You must also set `is_balanced_frequency` to `true`.<br> |

Reserve buying campaigns and self-serve contextual package campaigns need to set the targeting packages here. Those campaigns will only deliver to pages included in the targeting packages<br> |
| `interval_frequency_cap_reset_period`<br><br>*int64* | Custom period to reset frequency cap. In hours. Expressed as multiples of 24.<br><br><br>For example, to show ad no more than 3 times every 48 hours, reset period should be set to 48 (hours) and `frequency_cap` should be set to 3. Implemented using a rolling window.<br><br><br>Target Frequency equivalent is `target_frequency_reset_period.` You must also set `is_balanced_frequency` to `true`.<br> |
| `num_curve_points`<br><br>*int64* | **Default value: **`400`<br>How many grid points to return from the curve.<br>If the value is not specified, the default value (800) is used. <br>If the value is larger than 800 then 800 will be used.<br> |

| `optimization_goal`<br><br>*string* | optimization_goal<br> |
| `prediction_mode`<br><br>*int64* | Set `0` to create a prediction of budget based on expected reach. `reach` value must be provided. <br> <br>  Set `1` to create a prediction of reach based on expected budget. `budget` value must be provided.<br> |
