## January 15, 2025
`v2.0.0`
#### Features:  

* Signals Gateway is a product within your own cloud instance that collects, processes, and transmits advertiser's first-party data to their desired destinations. It offers built-in features and tools for collecting, processing, and transmitting signals from one or more data sources to various data destinations with no pre-defined data purpose.
* Signals Gateway utilizes a "data pipelines" concept, which allows advertisers to efficiently manage their data flow by incorporating multiple data sources and destinations into each pipeline.
* Signals Gateway provides robust data collection tools, including Signals Gateway Pixel and Signals Gateway SDK options, for seamless data capture directly into Signals Gateway data sources.
* The Audience Generation Feature allows advertisers to set rules for creating audiences from their data through existing data pipelines, enabling them to use these curated audiences for campaigns and customer segmentation analysis.
* The Meta Conversions API plugin enables advertisers to route data to The Conversions API for Meta advertising purposes, with components governed by Meta's Business Tool Terms.
* The Google BigQuery plugin will provide a dedicated data destination for connecting to Google Cloud BigQuery, allowing data flow into BigQuery for data analytics.
* The Custom HTTPS Destination can be used to stream events to a custom endpoint securely, through basic auth, Oauth or an API key.

#### Features:  

* We will provide Cloudflare and App Runner setup for both agency domains and tenant domains. **Note**: Customer needs a paid Cloudflare account if selecting Cloudflare setup.
* Automatic file events upload is now available at the overview page.
* Conversions API Gateway systems using AWS App Runner as their cloud provider are now able to use the automatic file upload feature which runs through async tasks.
* Onboarding Multiple Pixels from Events Manager. This feature enables users of Events Manager to choose multiple Meta datasets and set them up on both new and existing Conversions API Gateway systems.
* Cost monitoring tool. This feature will allow users with Conversions API Gateway systems using AWS App Runner as their cloud provider to monitor and set alerts for their cost usage.
* The Conversions API Gateway on App Runner uses Amazon-managed Prometheus to store time-series metrics that power the control plane UI, replacing AWS Timestream.
* PreInstallation Check. This feature aims to reduce the time to error discovery during installation.
* We have implemented first-party domain setup notification during system migrations, allowing users to easily track and manage their domain setup status. This update ensures that users are aware when their domain is successfully set up and ready for use after a migration, providing a seamless experience.
* App Runner based solution will allow creation of multiple accounts and optimized domains.
* App Runner based solution will allow domain management through AWS (up to 3 domains) and Cloudflare (up to 5,000 domains).

## October 24, 2023
`v1.11.0`
#### Features:  

* User experience and functionality have been merged and improved for Conversions API Gateway and Conversions API Gateway for Multiple Accounts. Now newly installed Conversions API Gateway will have the same user experience and functionality.
    * Installing Conversions API Gateway from Events Manager is basically the same as installing with the AWS CloudFormation template provided in the developer document. The difference is that some information will be pre-populated in the Events Manager setup process and the pixel chosen in the Events Manager is connected by default.
    * When the custom domain routing is set up with Cloudflare, the newly installed Conversions API Gateway will work as Conversions API Gateway for Multiple Accounts.
* Improved Kubernetes implementation to have support for infrastructure lifecycle management to keep Conversions API Gateway instance on the latest optimized infrastructure
* Users don't need to provide email and password in AWS CloudFormation when creating an instance. Users will use an invitation link generated in the Outputs tab of AWS CloudFormation to create an admin account and login.

Once this feature is activated, individual users are given the option to enable two-factor authentication for their accounts if they so choose.

## September 11, 2023
`v1.10.0`
#### Features:  

* We have removed the requirement to specify a domain during installation for Conversions API Gateway for Multiple Accounts.

#### Bug fixes:

* We are disabling the update of any component other than Solutions Installer if Solutions Installer is not updated for the users who have automatic updates turned off. For the users who have automatic updates disabled, we want the Solutions Installer component to be updated first because other components' updates will fail unless the Solutions Installer is updated.

    * Enabling and disabling of Pixel IDs which will block the events flowing from Pixel on website to the Conversions API Gateway. (Note: Disabling will not block Pixel event being fired directly from website to Meta).
    * Enabling and disabling of publishing of all the events from the Conversions API Gateway to Events Manager.
    * Activate and Deactivate option to control incoming events to Events Manager.

#### Bug fixes:

*  As of 1.4.0, AWS S3 bucket is created during the installation process. That S3 bucket serves as the storage for automatic configuration backup. Its access is controlled by the IAM role and strictly limited to the usage by the Conversions API Gateway instance.

#### Bug fixes:

* Updated the Cloudformation template to enforce EBS encryption.

## June 6, 2022

#### Features:  

* The Conversions API Gateway will now support the IPv6 capability of AWS. Advertisers need to disconnect and re-install the Conversions API Gateway v1.3.0 or later if they want to use the IPv6 capability.
* Creation of new Lambda function in AWS: this Lambda function is invoked only during installation of Conversions API Gateway to get the IPv6 address assigned to the EC2 instance. Its access is controlled by the IAM role and strictly limited to the usage by the Conversions API Gateway instance.
* For advertisers who switch to v1.3.0, the Conversions API Gateway will provision and install a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instead of using the default VPC and:
    * The Conversions API Gateway will be installed in the Public subnet of the new VPC.
    * Advertisers using IPv6 need to create an additional AAAA DNS record pointing to the IPv6 address of the EC2 instance.
* Provisioning Web UI change: the "Click to Conversions API Gateway" button is now removed. Customers are prompted to go back to Events Manager to complete setup.

#### Bug fixes:

* Added log rotation for the Conversions API Gateway log and System log.
* Fixed the issue of UI not loading for a few advertisers.
* Only `GET` requests are supported by the image pixel endpoint

## March 29, 2022

#### Features:

This update enables the web server on the Conversions API Gateway to restore original IP addresses from the custom header. Learn more about restoring original IP addresses [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170786-Restoring-original-visitor-IPs).
