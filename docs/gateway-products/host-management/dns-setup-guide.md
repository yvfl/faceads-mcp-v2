# How to Set Up DNS Record on Cloudflare



This document will guide you through the steps to set up a DNS record on Cloudflare correctly.

### For new DNS records, make sure the 'Proxy status' setting is set as 'DNS only'.

### For existing DNS records, edit their settings and change 'Proxy status' to 'DNS only'.

### In some cases, if you need to use the 'Proxied' mode, for example, certificates are provisioned via proxy, please make sure the encryption mode under the TLS/SSL setting is set to 'Full'.
