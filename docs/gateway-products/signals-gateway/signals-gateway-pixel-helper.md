# Signals Gateway Pixel Helper



This guide shows you how to use the Signals Gateway Pixel Helper tool to verify your Signals Gateway Pixel is working properly, troubleshoot common errors, and improve Signals Gateway Pixel performance.

The Signals Gateway Pixel Helper is a Chrome Browser extension that runs in the background to automatically review websites for Signals Gateway Pixel code. When the extension is installed, a < / > icon, the SIgnals Gateway Pixel Helper icon, will appear in the upper right corner of the browser next to the address bar.

When a website has a Signals Gateway Pixel installed, the Signals Gateway Pixel Helper icon turns blue and a small badge will appear indicating the number of Pixels found on the webpage. If the icon does not turn blue, no Signals Gateway Pixels are installed on this webpage. Click the SIgnals Gateway Pixel Helper icon and a small popup appears with information you can use to verify, troubleshoot, and improve the Pixel.

* An error in the code.
* If the Signals Gateway Pixel fires on a dynamic event, such as a button click. The error will disappear upon clicking on the button.

If the event is sent with different custom data parameters, those parameters should be aggregated into a single Signals Gateway Pixel event.
