# Signals Gateway Pixel Setup in Google Tag Manager



There are two types of native Meta Pixel installations:

1. Meta Pixel installed through [Custom HTML tags](#sgw-customhtml-version)
2. Meta Pixel installed through a [Meta-provided Google Tag Manager template](#sgw-template-version)

To find whether you have the Custom HTML version or Meta-provided version, follow the steps below. Note that these instructions reflect the state of Google Tag Manager at the time of this document's publication, and may not reflect all updates to that product.

* Log in to your Google Tag Manager account and open your Workspace. In the main menu, click **Tags**.
* Find the tag name on which the Meta Pixel is installed. If the "Tag Type" says "Custom HTML" and the HTML field has the Meta-provided Javascript for Meta Pixel, you have a setup where the Meta Pixel is installed through Custom HTML tags. Follow the [Signals Gateway Pixel Setup in Google Tag Manager setup with Custom HTML version](#sgw-customhtml-version).

* Find the tag name on which the Meta (Facebook) Pixel is installed. If the "Tag Type" says "Facebook Pixel", you have a setup where the Meta Pixel is installed through the Facebook-provided Google Tag Manager template. Follow the [Signals Gateway Pixel Setup in Google Tag Manager setup with Template version](#sgw-template-version).

Follow these steps when the Meta Pixel tag is installed through Custom HTML.

### 1. Open Signals Gateway Pixel Settings  

Log in to your Signals Gateway account and select your Signals Gateway Pixel from your list of Data sources.

Open the **Setup guide** tab. In this tab, you'll see instructions for installing the Signals Gateway Pixel on your website. Within those instructions, find the following values, which you'll use to connect to Google Tag Manager.

* The Pixel host (for example, https://sgw.test.com/)
* The Pixel script URL (for example, https://sgw.test.com/sdk/123456789/events.js)

See the example code below and the explanation of the relevant values in the table that follows. You will find the following Javascript code snippet under "Option 2" -> "Alternate Method"

```html
Paste the pixel code into the bottom of the header section just above the </head> tag. Install the code on every page of your website.

<!-- Signals Gateway Pixel Code -->
  <script>
  !function(a,h,e,v,n,t,s)
    {if(a.cbq)return;n=a.cbq=function(){n.callMethod?

n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};

if(!a._cbq)a._cbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
    n.queue=[];t=h.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
    t.src=v;s=h.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,
document,'script',
    'https://sgw.test.com/sdk/123456789/events.js');
    cbq('setHost', 'https://sgw.test.com/');
    cbq('init', 123456789);
    cbq('track', 'PageView');
  </script>
    <!-- End Signals Gateway Pixel Code →
```

### 2. Add Signals Gateway Pixel Code

* Edit the current "Custom HTML" tags where you have Meta Pixel added. Add the Signals Gateway Pixel code from Step 1 below the existing Meta Pixel Code.

* Modify all track commands.
    * For "track", "trackCustom" commands, make sure the 4th argument is "eventID" and it is passed.
    * For "trackSingle", "trackSingleCustom" commands, make sure the fifth argument is "eventID" and it is passed.
    * Make sure you have the same track commands for both Meta Pixel (fbq) and Signals Gateway Pixel (cbq).
