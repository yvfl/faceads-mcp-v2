# Publish Events to a Custom Data Destination



You can set up and send data from your data pipeline to a custom data destination, such as your own API. When you are setting up a custom destination, there are options you can update the event templates so that it matches the data format the endpoint is expecting.

Once setup is complete, your data pipeline will be able to send outbound events to this custom destination. Below is the list of parameters which are sent to the custom data destination.

**Note**: Custom data destinations that don't respond within 5 seconds will timeout and may not receive data.
