# Ads MCP Server


**The ads MCP server is a Meta-hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server** that lets you manage Meta ads directly from an AI agent. It is one of [Meta's ads AI connectors](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/meta-ads-ai-connectors) — a family of integrations that expose Meta business surfaces to third-party AI clients through structured, permission-scoped tools.

The server is remote-hosted at `https://mcp.facebook.com/ads` and works with any MCP-compatible AI agent.

## Who it's for

- **Advertisers using AI assistants** who want to manage Meta ads through a chat interface instead of Ads Manager or code
- **Developers building AI-native ad workflows** who want structured, permission-scoped access to ads capabilities without wiring up individual endpoints
