# Check seller eligibility



This page gives guidance on which sellers to onboard into managed partner ads, as well as how to check eligibility. You may begin onboarding any eligible seller, but consider prioritizing sellers with a higher average purchase value. Such sellers tend to have better return on ad spend.

## Before you begin

Before you check the eligibility of a seller, make sure you have completed these steps:

1. [Create an Admin System User](collaborative-ads/managed-partner-ads/api-guide/prerequisites/create-system-user.md)
2. [Assign Permissions to the Admin System User](collaborative-ads/managed-partner-ads/api-guide/prerequisites/assign-permissions-to-system-user.md)
3. [Generate an Access Token for the Admin System User](collaborative-ads/managed-partner-ads/api-guide/prerequisites/generate-access-token-system-user.md)

## Seller eligibility criteria

A seller qualifies when it meets the following criteria:

* Average purchase value in the past 28 days
* Number of purchases in the past 28 days

**Note:** Sellers with a higher average purchase value tend to have better return on ad spend. Prioritize these sellers when you onboard. You can download a list of your eligible and recommended sellers from the Discover page in Collaboration Center.

## Required permissions

To call the Seller Eligibility API, you need the following permissions:

* Business Admin
* Catalog Admin
* Manage Credit
* App Developer
