# Async API User Guide



Asynchronous computing is a paradigm where the user does not expect the system to execute a workload immediately; instead, the system schedules it for execution sometime in the near future without blocking the latency-critical path of the application. This page gives you guidance and the best practices to follow to retrieve the results of the async API.

## Poll the async session ID for results

### Request

```
curl -G -X GET \
  -d 'fields=id,status,result' \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  "https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<ASYNC_SESSION_ID>"
```

### Response

```
{
  "id": "<ASYNC_SESSION_ID>",
  "status": "enum string",
  "result": "string"
}
```

#### Response parameters
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id`<br><br>numeric string | The ID of the async request.<br><br>Also known as the `ASYNC_SESSION_ID`. |
| `status`<br><br>enum string | The status of the async job.<br><br>**Values:**<br><br>* `UNKNOWN`<br>* `NOT_STARTED`<br>* `IN_PROGRESS`<br>* `COMPLETED`<br>* `FAILED` |
| `result`<br><br>string | The result as returned by the async job.<br><br>For details, look at the corresponding API call's success and failure responses. |

## Polling best practices
The polling requests also count towards the overall [API rate limit](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting) for your application. Consider using exponential backoff for polling.
