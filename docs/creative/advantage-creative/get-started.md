# Get Started with Advantage+ Creative



This guide covers creating ads and ad creatives with opted-in Advantage+ creative features.

**Warning:** Previously, Advantage+ creative was only supported through standard enhancements, a bundle of Advantage+ creative features. Starting with Marketing API v22.0 and applying to all subsequent versions, the opt-in and preview functionality for standard enhancements will be deprecated. Instead, you can opt-in to or preview individual Advantage+ creative features by following the guidelines outlined in this document.

## Before You Begin

Set up your ad campaigns using the following instructions:

1. [Create an ad campaign](get-started/basic-ad-creation/create-an-ad-campaign.md)
2. [Create an ad set](get-started/basic-ad-creation/create-an-ad-set.md)

## Step 1: Create an d or ad creative opted into Advantage+ creative features

[Create an ad](get-started/basic-ad-creation/create-an-ad.md) using the [`/ads` endpoint](reference/adgroup.md) or [create a standalone ad creative](get-started/basic-ad-creation/create-an-ad-creative.md) using the [`/adcreatives`](reference/ad-creative.md) endpoint. With either approach, specify the individual opt-in features in the `creative_features_spec` parameter.

### Example request
To implement the `image_touchups`, `inline_comment`, and `image_templates` opt-in features:

```html
// creative example
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name=Advantage+ Creative Creative' \
  -F 'degrees_of_freedom_spec={
    "creative_features_spec": {

Features specified as `OPT_IN` but ineligible for the given ad setup will be automatically removed from the `creative_features_spec` parameter. For example, `image_templates` (or **Add overlays**) is not eligible to be applied to video format creatives — if you opt-in to this feature on a video ad, it will be automatically removed as ineligible.

To confirm the final configuration, use a `GET` request to retrieve the `creative_features_spec` parameter.

**Warning:** Don't worry if you see `standard_enhancements` or any standard enhancements sub-features appended to `creative_features_spec` when you retrieve it. As long as they are not set to `OPT_IN`, they will not be applied. Standard enhancements are in the process of being deprecated, and this behavior will be phased out once the deprecation is complete.

### Music

Most Advantage+ creative features can be opted into using the `creative_features_spec` parameter with the exception of the `music` feature which is implemented with the `asset_feed_spec` parameter. To opt out of the `music` feature, pass the `assest_feed_spec.audios` parameter in as empty.

#### Example request

To opt into the `music` feature using the `asset_feed_spec` parameter:

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Advantage+ Creative Music"' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={
       "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>"
     }' \
  -F 'asset_feed_spec={
       "audios": [
         {
           "type": "random"
         }
       ]
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
```

### Translate voiceover

The `translate_voiceover` feature automatically translates spoken audio in video ads, generating a voiceover that sounds similar to the original speaker.

#### Limitations

- The translated voiceover cannot be edited or regenerated.
- Text overlays and captions in the video will not be translated by this feature. To translate text overlays, use the `image_text_translation` feature. To translate ad copy text, use the `text_translation` feature.
- Only English-to-Spanish is currently supported. Additional language pairs are planned for future releases.
- Video preview shows the first 6 seconds of the translated audio. The full translated video is generated asynchronously after publish.

#### Example request: Standalone ad creative

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name=Advantage+ Creative Voiceover Translation' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={
    "video_data": {
      "video_id": "<VIDEO_ID>",
      "message": "Check out our latest product!",
      "link_description": "Learn more",
      "call_to_action": {
        "type": "LEARN_MORE",
        "value": {
          "link": "<URL>"
        }
      }
    },
    "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>"
  }' \
  -F 'degrees_of_freedom_spec={
    "creative_features_spec": {
      "translate_voiceover": {
        "enroll_status": "OPT_IN"
      }
    }
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
```

#### Example request: Ad with inline creative

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'adset_id=<ADSET_ID>' \
  -F 'status=PAUSED' \
  -F 'creative={
    "name": "Advantage+ Creative Voiceover Ad",
    "object_story_spec": {
      "video_data": {
        "video_id": "<VIDEO_ID>",
        "message": "Check out our latest product!",
        "link_description": "Learn more",
        "call_to_action": {
          "type": "LEARN_MORE",
          "value": {
            "link": "<URL>"
          }
        }
      },
      "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>"
    },
    "degrees_of_freedom_spec": {
      "creative_features_spec": {
        "translate_voiceover": {
          "enroll_status": "OPT_IN"
        }
      }
    }
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads
```

The `translate_voiceover` feature can be combined with other translation features such as `text_translation` in the same `creative_features_spec`. This allows both ad copy text and video voiceover to be translated simultaneously.

#### Example request: Combining translation features

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'degrees_of_freedom_spec={
    "creative_features_spec": {
      "translate_voiceover": {
        "enroll_status": "OPT_IN"
      },
      "text_translation": {
        "enroll_status": "OPT_IN"
      }
    }
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
```

**Note:** If the opted-in features include features generated with AI, you must create the ad with a `PAUSED` status, then follow Step 2 and Step 3 below to complete the publishing process. If no AI-generated features are included, Step 2 and Step 3 are optional, and you can create the ad with an `ACTIVE` status.

**Note:** When creating an ad through the `/ads` endpoint, the `status` field on the ad is set to `PAUSED` by default.

## Step 2: Preview for Advantage+ creative

See the [Ad Previews reference](generatepreview.md) for more information on the existing functionality of previews.

To preview an Advantage+ creative feature, add the `creative_feature` parameter to your existing preview request with the desired feature name specified.

Features that support preview include: `image_templates`, `image_touchups`, `video_auto_crop`, `enhance_cta`, `text_optimizations`, `image_background_gen`, `image_uncrop`, `description_automation`, `translate_voiceover`, `image_animation`, `video_filtering`, and `video_uncrop`.

#### Example request

```html
curl -X GET -G \
  -d 'ad_format="DESKTOP_FEED_STANDARD"' \
  -d 'creative_feature=<FEATURE_NAME> \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_ID>/previews
```

#### Example response

```html
{
  "data": [
    {
      "body": "<iframe src='<PREVIEW_URL>'></iframe>",
      "transformation_spec": {
        "<FEATURE_NAME>": [
          {
            "body": "<iframe src='<PREVIEW_URL>'></iframe>",
            "status": "eligible"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Click on the returned URL to see the previews.

**Note:** If a `transformation_spec` object is not returned, the creative is not eligible for the Advantage+ creative feature on the chosen placement, and the feature will not be applied.

Once you have reviewed the previews and deemed them acceptable to publish, set the ad to `ACTIVE`, if it is not already. If any of the previews are not acceptable, create a new ad or ad creative without the corresponding features opted-in.

## Step 3: Set the ad status to `ACTIVE`

When your ad is ready, set its status to `ACTIVE`.

#### Example request

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'status=ACTIVE' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<AD_ID>
```
