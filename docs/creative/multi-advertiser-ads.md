# Multi-advertiser Ads



**Warning:** Multi-advertiser ads delivery will become `OPT-IN` by default beginning August 19, 2024. Partners will need to implement the multi-advertiser request in order to opt out of multi-advertiser ads. By default, Meta enrolls ads created on or after August 19 in multi-advertiser ads if they do not specify the `enroll_status` field within the `contextual_multi_ads` field.

Multi-advertiser ads show ads from multiple advertisers to people who are likely to continue shopping. Multi-advertiser ads are available for select placements on Facebook and Instagram. For more information, please visit the [Business Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1024826868233885).

## API support for multi-advertiser ads

Multi-advertiser ads are supported in all versions of the Marketing API. Multi-advertiser ads support all campaign objectives and all ad formats across all available placements. The `enroll_status` field must be provided with either an `OPT_IN` or `OPT_OUT` value. Ads created on or after August 19, 2024 that do not specify the `enroll_status` field will be opted into multi-advertiser ads by default.
