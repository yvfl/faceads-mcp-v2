# Mobile App Custom Audiences



Build audiences based on people's actions in your app that meet your criteria. This feature allows you to build an audience who, for example:

- "Passed Level 8 in the last 10 days"
- "Used app in the last 8 days but hasn't purchased anything"
- "Added to cart but not purchased"

This solution uses logged named events through our [Facebook SDKs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/sdk), [App Events API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events), or via [Mobile Measurement Partners](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/measuring/measurement-partners). Examples of events to log include "Installed", "Added to Cart", "Purchased", or "Achieved a Level".

### Limitations

* `subtype` for engagement custom audiences is only supported for video.
* Mobile App Custom Audiences for inclusion targeting is no longer supported for the `POST /{ad-account-id}/adsets` endpoint for iOS 14.5 SKAdNetwork campaigns.
* New iOS 14.5 app install campaigns will no longer be able to use app connections targeting.

## Create an audience {#create}

To create Custom Audiences from your mobile app, the ad account must accept the [Terms of Service for Custom Audiences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php), in [Ads Manager](https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage). To sign the terms:

- You need to be an Admin, Developer, or Insights User for the ad account.
- Your ad account should be listed as an Advertising account on [your app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) settings.

To create your audience:

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="My Test Mobile App Custom Audience"' \
  -F 'rule={
       "inclusions": {
         "operator": "or",
         "rules": [
           {
             "event_sources": [
               {
                 "id": "<APP_ID>",
                 "type": "app"
               }
             ],
             "retention_seconds": 8400,
             "filter": {
               "operator": "and",
               "filters": [
                 {
                   "field": "event",
                   "operator": "eq",
                   "value": "fb_mobile_purchase"
                 }
               ]
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }' \
  -F 'prefill=1' \
  -F 'audience_labels=["HIGH_VALUE_CUSTOMERS"]' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customaudiences
```

This returns the `id` of the audience upon success. These parameters are most relevant:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name`<br><br>type: String | **Required.**<br><br>Name of your custom audience. |
| `description`<br><br>type: String | **Optional.**<br><br>Description of your custom audience. |
| `rule`<br><br>type: JSON object | **Optional.**<br><br>Rule to define the audience. See [Audience Rules](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md). |

Each ad account can create a maximum of `200` custom audiences via Custom Audiences from Your Mobile App. Make a `POST` request to:

```
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customaudiences
```

Use these fields:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name`<br><br>type: string | **Required.**<br><br>Name of your Custom Audience |
| `retention_days`<br><br>type: integer | **Required.**<br><br>How long someone is in this audience. The minimum number is `1`. The maximum number is `180`.<br>If `retention_days` is 14, and on day 13, an audience member triggers an app event matching your criteria, then Facebook extends their time in the audience 14 more days. Someone is in an audience N days from the last matching event they triggered. |
| `rule`<br><br>type: JSON Object | **Required.**<br><br>Rules to define the audience. See [Audience Rules](#rules) |
| `audience_labels`<br><br>type: string | **Optional.**<br><br>Choose a label that describes this audience. Labels may be used to find audiences for your ads more effectively. [About audience labels](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/706325895111530).<br><br>**Engaged audiences:**<br><br>* `QUALIFIED_LEADS` — Leads that meet your qualification criteria.<br>* `DISQUALIFIED_LEADS` — Leads that don't meet your qualification criteria.<br>* `APP_USERS` — People that are currently using your app.<br>* `TRIAL_USERS` — People who started a trial of your product.<br>* `ENGAGED_USERS` — People that showed interest but are not customers.<br><br>**Customers:**<br><br>* `HIGH_VALUE_CUSTOMERS` — Customers you consider valuable to your business.<br>* `LOW_VALUE_CUSTOMERS` — Customers who are of low or negative value to your business.<br>* `AT_RISK` — Customers who are showing signs of disengaging or churning.<br>* `DISENGAGED` — Customers who have not made a purchase recently or stopped subscribing.<br>* `CUSTOMERS` — Your existing customers. |

## Audience rules {#rules}

To determine who gets added to the Custom Audience, define a rule based on events in your app. A rule is a JSON object with key-value pairs and can reference multiple app events. You can define the rule based on specific events and their parameters and also the aggregation. See [Audience Rules](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md) for more information. See also:

* [Audience Rule Syntax](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#audience-rules-syntax)
* [Rule Set Syntax](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#rule_set_syntax)
* [Inclusion And Exclusion Rule Syntax](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#inclusion-exclusion): Under `event_sources`, set `id` to your app's ID and `type` to `app`.
* [Filters](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#filter)
* [Filter Rules](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#filter-rules):
    * Use `'event'` as `field`, if the filter is to specify an event. Parameters that match App events sent by app; for example, "_appVersion", "_value", and so on.
    * If the `field` attribute is set to `"event"`, the value must be set to an event name. Use the App Event API to see app events and parameters reported by the pixel.
* [Aggregation Functions](audiences/guides/audience-rules.md#aggregate): The following aggregation functions are available for Mobile App Custom Audiences: `"count"`,`"sum"`, `"avg"`, `"min"`, and `"max"`.

    }
}
```

## App events API {#app_events_api}
Query which app events and parameters an app reported to Facebook. You can use these events and parameters directly for [creating Custom Audiences](#create). You need an access token associated with the `app_id` with an admin, developer, or advertiser role.

Make a `GET` request:

```
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<APP_ID>/app_event_types
```

The response is JSON containing a `data` array of JSON dictionaries having these fields:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `event_name`<br><br>type: string | App event type to use in [rule](#rules). |
| `display_name`<br><br>type: string | Human-readable name of event type |
| `description`<br><br>type: string | Verbose description of standard event |
| `parameters`<br><br>type: array | array of JSON dictionaries describing parameters for this event `{`<br>`"parameter_name": "fb_currency", `<br>`"display_name": "Currency", `<br>`"description": "Currency for event"`<br>`}`<br><br>`parameter_name`: string, App param type to use in [rule](#rules)<br><br>`display_name`: string, Human-readable name of event type<br><br>`description`: string, Verbose description of parameter, if a standard param |

Shows [iOS SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events#events) and [Android SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events#events) constants for predefined event names to send via App Events, and "wire name" for event sent over the network. You should specify the wire name in Custom Audiences from your mobile app rules. You can send custom events using your own names; if so, build rules based on strings used for names.

|-|-|-|
|`FBAppEventNameAchievedLevel`|`EVENT_NAME_ACHIEVED_LEVEL`|`fb_mobile_level_achieved`|

[iOS SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events#params) and [Android SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events#params) constants for "standard" parameter names sent with app events. Include "wire names" for parameters sent over the network. Use the "wire name" in Custom Audiences from your mobile app rules with standard parameters. Use any string names you define for custom parameters sent via App Events to build rules.

|iOS SDK constant|Android SDK constant|Wire name|

|`FBAppEventParameterNameContentID`|EVENT_PARAM_CONTENT_ID|`fb_content_id`|
