# Flight Ads - Template Tags



When you create flight ads, use these template tags in the ad creative and deep-link URLs. When Facebook displays your ad, it replaces the template tags with that person's travel selections.

**You should provide template tags in double curly brackets**: `{{....}}`

**Before using template tags, make sure you provide all required details through your [Flight Events](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/dynamic-ads-for-flights/events)**.

For example, the title of your ad could be:

> Complete your booking to `{{flight.destination_city}}` today!

And the template URL of your ad could deep link people straight to the flight they were interested in, with the right departure and return date:

> `https://www.(...).com/flights?from={{flight.origin_airport}}&to={{flight.destination_airport}}&departure={{trip.departing_departure_date date_format:Y-m-d}}&return={{trip.returning_departure_date date_format:Y-m-d}}&num={{trip.num_travelers}}`

## Dynamic dates {#dates}

Dynamic dates for template tags enable you to continuously update the dates that appear in your ad, without having to re-upload the data in feed. You can use these for Advantage+ catalog ads used in a particular vertical, such as for hotels, flights, destinations, automotive, and so on.

- For syntax and usage, see [Template Tags for Hotels, Dynamic Dates](hotel-ads/template-tags.md#dates).
- For available options, see [Template Tags for Hotels, Date Template Tags](hotel-ads/template-tags.md#datetag)
