## `blame_field_specs` {#blame_field_specs}

This is a property included in the `error_data` blob of any API call that results in a validation error, which indicates which field(s) is at fault for the validation error. This can be used to provide contextual errors, e.g. displaying an error right next to the field(s) at fault in the GUI of an ad creation tool.

`blame_field_specs` is an array, where each element of the array is a `blame_field_spec` which indicates a single field from the API spec that is at fault.

A `blame_field_spec` itself is an array also, which indicates the name of the field that is at fault and the location of this field within the overall API spec provided.

### Examples

#### Single field at fault

```
{
  "error":{
    "type":"Exception",
    "message":"The budget for your Ad-Set is too low.  It must be at least $1.00 per day.",
    "code":1487901,
    "is_transient":false,
    "error_data":{
      "blame_field_specs":[
        ["daily_budget"]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Indicates that the `daily_budget` field of the API spec is at fault and in this case it was too low.

#### Multiple fields at fault

```
"blame_field_specs":[
  ["targeting_spec", "interested_in"],
  ["bid_info", "impressions"]
]
```

Indicates that there is an error related to the `interested_in` subfield within the `targeting_spec` field of the API spec, and the error is also related to field `impressions` within the `bid_info` field of the API spec.
