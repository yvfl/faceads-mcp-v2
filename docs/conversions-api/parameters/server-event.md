# Server Event Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `event_name`<br><br>string | **Required.**  <br>A [standard event](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#standard-events) or [custom event](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) name. This field is used to deduplicate events sent by both web (via Meta Pixel) or app (via SDK or App Events API) and the Conversions API. The `event_id` parameter is also used in deduplication.<br><br>For the same customer action, `event` from the browser or app event matches `event_name` from the server event. If we find a match between events sent within 48 hours of each other, we only consider the first one. If a server and browser/app event arrive at approximately the same time (that is, within 5 minutes of each other), we favor the browser/app event. Learn more about [Deduplicate Pixel and Server Events](conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events.md). |
| `event_time`<br><br>integer | **Required.**  <br>A Unix timestamp in seconds indicating when the actual event occurred. The specified time may be earlier than the time you send the event to Facebook. This is to enable batch processing and server performance optimization. You must send this date in GMT time zone.<br><br>The `event_time` can be up to 7 days before you send an event to Facebook. If any `event_time` in `data` is greater than 7 days in the past, we return an error for the entire request and process no events. |
| `user_data`<br><br>object | **Required.**  <br>A map that contains customer information data. See [Customer Information Parameters](conversions-api/parameters/customer-information-parameters.md) for options. See [Advanced Matching](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) for comparable options available for data sent via Meta Pixel. |
| `custom_data`<br><br>object | **Optional.**  <br>A map that includes additional business data about the event. See [Custom Data Parameters](conversions-api/parameters/custom-data.md) for more information. |
| `event_source_url`<br><br>string | **Optional.**  <br>The browser URL where the event happened. The URL should match the verified domain.  <br><br>**Note:** The `event_source_url` is required for website events shared using the Conversions API. |
| `opt_out`<br><br>boolean | **Optional.**  <br>A flag that indicates we should not use this event for ads delivery optimization. If set to `true`, we only use the event for attribution. |
| `event_id`<br><br>string | **Optional.**  <br>This ID can be any *unique* string chosen by the advertiser. The `event_id` and `event_name` parameters are used to deduplicate events sent by both web (via the Meta Pixel) or app (via SDK or App Events API) and the Conversions API. Note that while `event_id` is marked optional, it is recommended for event deduplication.<br><br>For deduplication, the `eventID` from a browser or app event must match the `event_id` in the corresponding server event. Learn more about [Handling Duplicate Pixel and Conversions API Events](conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events.md).<br><br>An order number or transaction ID are two potential identifiers that can be used for `event_id`. For example, if a customer makes two purchases on your website with order numbers 123 and 456, each Conversions API call would need to include its respective order number for `event_id`. This allows us to properly distinguish these two purchase events as distinct orders. The two corresponding browser Pixel purchase events would need to also send the same order numbers in the `eventID` parameter for us to understand that there were only two events that took place, not four unique purchases.<br><br>For other events without an intrinsic ID number, a random number (so long as the same random number is sent between browser and server events) can be used. |
| `action_source`<br><br>string | **Required.**  <br>This field allows you to specify where your conversions occurred. Knowing where your events took place helps ensure your ads go to the right people. By using the Conversions API, you agree that the `action_source` parameter is accurate to the best of your knowledge.<br><br>The values you can send in the `action_source` field are as follows:<br><br>* `email` — Conversion happened over email.<br>* `website` — Conversion was made on your website.<br>* `app` — Conversion was made on your mobile app.<br>* `phone_call` — Conversion was made over the phone.<br>* `chat` — Conversion was made via a messaging app, SMS, or online messaging feature.<br>* `physical_store` — Conversion was made in person at your physical store.<br>* `system_generated` — Conversion happened automatically, for example, a subscription renewal that's set to auto-pay each month.<br>* `business_messaging` — Conversion was made from ads that click to Messenger, Instagram or WhatsApp.<br>* `other` — Conversion happened in a way that is not listed.<br><br>**Note**: All action source values enable ad measurement and custom audience creation capabilities. All action sources enable ad optimization capabilities. |
| `data_processing_options`<br><br>array | **Optional.**  <br>Processing options you would like to enable for a specific event. Current accepted value is `LDU` for Limited Data Use. An empty array can be sent to explicitly specify that this event shouldn't be processed with the Limited Data Use restrictions. Learn more about [Data Processing options](overview/data-processing-options.md). See [examples of Conversions API implementation](overview/data-processing-options.md#conversions-api-and-offline-conversions-api). |
| `data_processing_options_country`<br><br>integer | **Required**, if you send `LDU` under `data_processing_options`.  <br>A country that you want to associate to this data processing option. Current accepted values are `1`, for the United States of America, or `0`, to request that we geolocate that event. Learn more about [Data Processing options](overview/data-processing-options.md). See [examples of Conversions API implementation](overview/data-processing-options.md#conversions-api-and-offline-conversions-api). |
| `data_processing_options_state`<br><br>integer | **Required** in some cases. (See note below for details.)  <br>A state that you want to associate to this data processing option. Current accepted values are `1000`, for California, or `0`, to request that we geolocate that event.<br><br>**Note:**<br><br>* If you set a country, you must also set a state. Otherwise, we apply our geolocation logic to the entire event.<br>* This field is required if you send `LDU` under `data_processing_options` and do not provide an IP address.<br><br>Learn more about [Data Processing options](overview/data-processing-options.md). See [examples of Conversions API implementation](overview/data-processing-options.md#conversions-api-and-offline-conversions-api). |
| `app_data`<br><br>object | **Required for app events**<br><br>Parameters for sharing app data and device information with the Conversions API.<br><br>**Warning:** `extinfo` is a sub-parameter of `app_data`. |
| `extinfo`<br><br>object | **Required for app events**  <br>Extended device information, such as screen width and height.  This parameter is an array and values are separated by commas. When using extinfo, **all values are required and must be in the order indexed below**. If a value is missing, fill with an empty string as a placeholder.<br><br>Note:<br><br>* `version` must be `a2` for Android<br><br>* `version` must be `i2` for iOS |

| `referrer_url`<br><br>string | **Optional.**  <br>The HTTP referrer header as observed by the page triggering the Conversions API or Meta Pixel event. This is usually the preceding page in the browser. |
| `original_event_data`<br><br>object | **Optional.**  <br>All metadata fields advertisers can use to specify how a "delayed"  event should be associated with a past acquisition event.<br><br>We highly recommend using `original_event_data` when there's a delay between when an event is sent and a past acquisition event it should be associated with.<br>See [Original Event Data Parameters](conversions-api/parameters/original-event.md) for more information. |
| `customer_segmentation`<br><br>enum | **Optional.**  <br>Allows advertisers to specify the user segment that the user performing the event belongs to.
