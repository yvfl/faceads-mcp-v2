# Customer Information Parameters



The customer information parameters are a set of user identifiers you share alongside your event information. For more information about required and recommended parameters, see [Best Practices - Conversions API: Send Required and Recommended Parameters](conversions-api/best-practices.md#req-rec-params).

**Note:** In the Graph API v13.0 release there were new requirements around the combinations of customer information parameters that are considered valid. Please review the [best practices](conversions-api/best-practices.md#baseline-requirements-for-matching) to ensure your Conversions API integrations are not interrupted.

Please visit the [Meta Privacy and Data Use Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/privacy-and-data?Data-Use-&-Ads) to learn what data is sent when using the Conversions API.

Our systems are designed to not accept customer information that is unhashed Contact Information, unless noted below. Contact Information is information that personally identifies individuals, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers, that we use for matching purposes only. If you are using the [Meta Business SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/business-sdk), the hashing is done automatically.

## Pixel Comparison

You can send many of the customer information parameters through the Meta Pixel, though some (for example, `client_user_agent`) are sent automatically as part of how the internet works. For example, to send `external_id` through the Pixel, use the following code:

```js
fbq('init', 'PIXEL_ID', {'external_id': 12345});
```

Read about the other parameters you can pass with Pixel in the [Advanced Matching documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching).

Vice versa, make sure to apply the same set of customer information parameters your system is currently sharing to the browser side to the server side.

## Formatting the `user_data` Parameters

You must provide at least one of the following `user_data` parameters with the correct formatting in your request.

_**Note**: If you are using the [parameter builder library](conversions-api/parameter-builder-library.md), the format will contain an additional appendix at the end of each param. Check the parameter builder library page for more details._

**Warning:** Please download this CSV file for examples of properly normalized and hashed data for the parameters below.

IPV6 is preferable over IPV4 for IPV6-enabled users. The `client_ip_address` user data parameter must never be hashed.  <br>No spaces should be included. Always provide the real IP address to ensure accurate event reporting.  <br>**Note:** This information is automatically added to events sent through the browser, but it must be manually configured for events sent through the server.<br><br>**Example:**  <br>*IPV4:* 168.212.226.204  <br>*IPV6:* 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 |
