# Conversions API End-to-End Implementation


**Warning:** **Ads Management Standard Access is now Marketing API Access Tier**

**No code changes are needed.**

Tier labels have been updated: "Standard Access" is now **Limited Access**, and "Advanced Access" is now **Full Access**. The revised qualification threshold for Full Access has been reduced from 1,500 to **500 Marketing API calls** in the past 15 days. The underlying permission identifier remains the same, and existing access levels are preserved automatically. Learn more in the [Marketing API Access Tier documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/features-reference#marketing-api-access-tier).

The Conversions API supports advertisers' efforts to provide consumers with appropriate data transparency and control while also helping them to continue providing personal experiences. With the API, you can share data directly from your server, rather than through a browser.

### Benefits of integration

- **Lower-funnel data visibility**: The Conversions API allows you to share a wider array of data when compared to the Meta Pixel. With the API, you can make decisions taking into account more information, such as CRM data, lower funnel events (including qualified leads), and multi-site conversion paths across a website and a physical location.

- **Data control**:  When used via a Server-Only implementation (for example, without the Meta Pixel), the Conversions API gives you added control over what data you share. You can choose to append insights to your events, providing data such as product margins or historical information, like customer value scores.

- **Signal reliability**: Data sharing through the Conversions API may be more reliable than browser-based methods alone, like the Meta Pixel. The API is designed to be less susceptible to issues like a browser crash or connectivity problems. New industry data transmission restrictions may limit the efficacy of cookies and Pixel tracking, so the Conversions API helps you have control on sharing signals that may no longer be captured by the Pixel.

**Note:** **Additional Resources**: View the [Conversions API Direct Integration Playbook for Developers (PDF) ](https://www.facebook.com/gms_hub/share/conversions-api-direct-integration-playbook_english.pdf) and [Direct Integration Webinar for Developers](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/sessionsforsuccess/conversions-api)

## Overview

You can think about your Conversions API integration in two main stages:

- [**Preparation**](#preparation) — Select which [type of integration](#integration-types) makes sense for you, [define which events to send](#define-events), and [review available optimization options](#optimization-types).

- [**Execution**](#execution) — Learn how to [implement the API](#direct-integration). For this stage, you can also use a [partner integration](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1179210765468894).

The following is a snapshot of the complete integration process:

| Requirements | Full Integration | Optimization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select events to share with Meta with user consent (if any).<br><br>Set up your business' assets: Meta Pixel, Meta Application, Business Manager, Server Connection, System User. | **Step 1: One event** - Sending any event, manually, or automated using the system user's token. Completing this step means you have correctly set up authentication.<br><br>**Step 2: Fully Integrated** - You need to be sending some automated events to be considered integrated. Completing this milestone means you are able to optimize for Conversions API even in the event that you stop using the Pixel or the Pixel is blocked. | Once you are fully integrated, send enough automated funnel events to be considered fully onboarded. Then, optimize your match rate based on guidance from Event Match Quality.<br><br>Make sure:<br><br>- The events can be sent via either channel (browser or server) and it is not being double-counted.<br>- The events are being sent as close to real-time as possible.<br>- Provide customer information parameters to be used for identity matching. |

### Existing Pixel users
If you have an existing Meta Pixel integration, the Conversions API integration should be built as an extension of the Pixel integration, instead of as an entirely different connection.

### General consent
If you have logic for controlling consent with respect to sharing Pixel data, use the same logic with respect to sharing data via Conversions API.

### Alternatives
- If you want to optimize your ads for app events, please use the [App Events API](app-event-api.md).

## Preparation {#preparation}

### Pick your integration type {#integration-types}

To start, select the integration option you would like to implement:

| Setup | Approach Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Redundant Setup (Recommended)** | Send all events via both Pixel and Conversions API. This is the recommended setup for those who would like to keep the Pixel on their website, and are able to fully adopt the Conversions API.<br><br>To succeed, you must be able to generate a persistent `event_id` for both Pixel and Conversions API events. This means sending the same `event_name` and `event_id` on both the Pixel and the Conversions API event, in order to [deduplicate identical events](conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events.md).<br><br>This setup provides performance comparable to or better than using only the browser Pixel. The server can capture events that may not be tracked by the browser, such as purchases that occur on a separate website, lead conversions, or phone calls. |
| **Split Setup** | Send different types of events via Pixel and Conversions API. For example, you could send `PageView` and `ViewContent` via Pixel, and  `Lead` or `Purchase` via Conversions API.<br><br>This option is not as optimal as a redundant setup. Consider it if you do not want to use a fully redundant setup, and note that you might need to complete additional work as browsers change. |
| **Server-Only Implementation** | Only send events through the Conversions API, instead of through the browser. Implement either a **redundant setup** or a **split setup** before switching to this approach. |

### Define events to send {#define-events}

Once you have chosen your integration approach, you can define which events you want to send. Signals are most useful if they are matched to Meta user IDs, so it is important to think through what parameters you are sending to Meta with an event and how often you would like to send them.

#### Event options
Send events that are most relevant to your business. See a full list of supported [standard](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#standard-events) and [custom](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) Meta events.  

#### Event parameters
You can send multiple parameters inside each event. See [parameters used by Conversions API](conversions-api/parameters.md) to learn more about those fields.

You can add multiple types of IDs to your events, including `event_id`, `external_id` and `order_id`. It's important to know the difference between these parameters:

| ID | Description | How It Is Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [External ID](conversions-api/parameters/external-id.md) | Your unique ID for a specific customer. | Learn more about [External ID](conversions-api/parameters/external-id.md). |
| Event ID | A unique ID for a given event. | Used on event deduplication. This field is very important if you are sending events via both browser Pixel and conversions API. |
| Order ID | A unique ID for a given order. This parameter only works for purchase events and expects an `order_id` field in `custom_data`. | **This implementation is limited to select Meta partners. Contact your Meta representative for access.**<br><br>Used on purchase event deduplication, if you send events via both browser Pixel and conversions API.<br><br>- Once you send your first order, Meta discards the second one if:<br>- You send a second event with the same `order_id` within a specific time window, and<br>Meta resolves that the same user completed both orders.<br><br>You can deduplicate purchase events within two windows: 48 hours (recommended) or 28 days. This is the window between the first and second instances of the same event. |

#### Data freshness {#data-freshness}
Send events in real time or in [batches](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/making-multiple-requests) based on a specific timeline via the Conversions API. Sending your events in real time or within 1 hour helps ensure that they can be used for attribution and optimized for ad delivery.

Sending your events more than 2 hours after they occurred can cause a significant decrease in performance for ads optimized for those events. Events sent with a delay of 24 hours or more may experience significant issues with attribution and optimized ad delivery.

If you're sending events with long conversion windows, send the event as close to real time as possible from the point at which the full conversion is completed.

*Move on to the next step once you have:*

- *A list of events to send.*
- *The specific fields you want to send with each event.*
- *Defined how frequently you will send events.*

### Available optimization types {#optimization-types}

The Conversions API offers the following optimization types:

| Optimization Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Conversions Optimization | Optimize ad delivery to show ads to people most likely to make a conversion. |
| Value Optimization (also known as Return on Ads Spend Optimization) | Optimize ad delivery to show ads to people most likely to make a conversion of a specified value, such as purchases over $50. |
| Dynamic Product Ads | Optimize ad delivery to show ads for specific products to people most likely to purchase those specific products. |

## Execution {#execution}

There are two ways to implement your integration:

- [Direct Integration](#direct-integration) — You, as an advertiser, directly implement the Conversions API.
- [Integration as a Platform](#integration-as-a-platform) — You, as a marketing partner, offer conversions API as a service to your clients.

**Note:** Advertisers using the Conversions API through one of Meta's marketing partners should follow the partner's implementation guidelines.

## Direct integration {#direct-integration}

### Step 1: Set up requirements

Prior to using the Conversions API, set up the following assets:

| Asset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Meta Pixel](conversions-api/get-started.md#facebook_pixel) | When you send events through the Conversions API, they're processed and stored in the same way as the events you send through your Pixel. When you implement the Conversions API, you select which Pixel you want to send your events to.  <br><br>Sending your Conversions API events to a Pixel lets you use your Conversions API events in the same way you use your browser-based Pixel events for measurement, attribution, and ad delivery optimization.  Send events from the browser and your server to the same Meta Pixel ID. |
| [Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com) | You need a Business Manager to use the API. Business Manager helps advertisers integrate Meta marketing efforts across their business and with external partners. If you don't have a Business Manager, see the Help Center article on how to [Create a Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657). |
| Access Token | To use the Conversions API, you need an [access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens). There are two ways of getting your access token:<br><br>- [Via Events Manager](conversions-api/get-started.md#via-events-manager) (Recommended)<br>- [Using Your Own App](conversions-api/get-started.md#use-your-own-app) |

*Move on to [Implement the API](#implement-the-api) once you have the assets ready. Remember to save IDs for your assets, since you use those on your API calls.*

### Step 2: Implement the API {#implement-the-api}

Once you are done with the requirements, start the implementation process. While building on the Conversions API, always check the [developer documentation](conversions-api.md).

#### Test calls (optional)
If this is your first time using the API, start with a test call. To do that, you need a payload and a method for making API calls. After the call is completed, check Events Manager to verify the call worked as expected.

| Payload | API Call Method |
| --- | --- |
| Use the [Payload Helper](conversions-api/payload-helper.md) to generate a sample payload to be sent with your call. Follow the instructions listed on the tool. Your payload should look something like this:<br><br>```
{
  "data": [
   {
    "event_name": "Purchase",
    "event_time": 1601673450,
    "user_data": {
      "em": "7b17fb0bd173f625b58636fb796407c22b3d16fc78302d79f0fd30c2fc2fc068",
      "ph": null
     },
    "custom_data": {
      "currency": "USD",
      "value": "142.52"
    }
   }
  ]
}
```<br><br>If you want to test your payload from the Payload Helper, add your Pixel ID under **Test this Payload** and click on **Send to Test Events**. You should be able to see the event on **Events Manager** > **Your Pixel** > **Test Events**. Learn more about the [Test Events Tool](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#testEvents). | Once you are satisfied with your payload, decide how you want to make your call. You can use the Graph API Explorer (see [Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/explorer)) or your own servers. If you are using your servers, you can use CURL or the Meta Business SDK. Meta highly recommends [using the Meta Business SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/business-sdk).<br><br>Independently on your call method, you should call the `/{pixel_id}/events` endpoint and attach the JSON data generated by the Payload Helper. Once you make the call, you should get a response like this:<br><br>```
{
  "events_received": 1,
  "messages": [],
  "fbtrace_id": <FB-TRACE-ID>
}
``` |

After you complete your first call, verify your events on **Events Manager** > **Your Pixel** > **Overview**.

*Move on to [Send and Verify Events](#send-and-verify) once you have checked your test events in Events Manager.*

#### Send and verify events {#send-and-verify}

To start sending events, make a `POST` request to the API's `/events` edge. Attach a payload to your call —if you need help generating your payload, visit the [Payload Helper](conversions-api/payload-helper.md). See the following resources for more information and code samples:

- [Using the API > Send requests](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#send)
- [Dropped Events](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#dropped-events)
- [Upload Time versus Event Transaction Time](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#event-transaction-time)
- [Batch Requests](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#batch-requests)
- [Hashing](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#hashing)

After you start sending events, go to Events Manager and confirm that Meta has received the events you sent. Learn how to [Verify Your Events](conversions-api/using-the-api.md#verify).

*If your implementation is complementary to a browser Pixel, move on to [deduplication settings](#add-parameters-for-dedup). Otherwise, you are all set! Check [Support](#support) if you still have questions.*

### Step 3: Add parameters for deduplication  {#add-parameters-for-dedup}
If you're sending identical events from your Pixel and through the Conversions API, you need to set up deduplication for your events sent via both channels. First, read [developer documentation to understand the deduplication logic](conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events.md).

#### Event-based deduplication
If Meta finds the same server key combination (`event_id`, `event_name`) and browser key combination (`eventID`, `event`) sent to the same Pixel ID within 48 hours, Meta discards the later sent duplicate events.

To help ensure your events are deduplicated:

- For the corresponding events, make sure the following parameters are set to the same value:
    - `event_id` from your server event and `eventID` from your browser event
    - `event_name` from your server and browser events
- After you send duplicate events, check Events Manager to see if the correct events are being dropped.
- Ensure that each unique event sent via both Pixel and the Conversions API has its own `event_id`. This ID should not be shared with other events.

#### Alternative to event-based deduplication
While Event ID will always be the best way to deduplicate events, it's a fairly complex implementation. You can leverage alternative solutions by using external_id or fbp parameters. If you have configured the external_id or fbp parameters to be passed via both browser and server, Meta deduplicates events automatically if it detects the same event with the same external_id or fbp parameters within 48 hours.

### Optional Step 4: Explore Business SDK features
Explore [Business SDK features](conversions-api/guides/business-sdk-features.md). The Meta Business SDK has advanced features designed especially for Conversions API users:

- [Asynchronous Requests](conversions-api/guides/business-sdk-features.md#asynchronous-requests) — Use this feature if you do not want to block your program's execution to wait for a request to be completed. With this approach, you make your request and get a signal back from the server once it has been completed. While you wait for the response, the program can keep executing.
- [Concurrent Batching](conversions-api/guides/business-sdk-features.md#concurrent-batching) — Leverage asynchronous requests to increase throughput by utilizing resources more efficiently. Create batched requests to support use cases like event request workers, cron jobs, and more.
- [HTTP Service Interface](conversions-api/guides/business-sdk-features.md#http-service-interface) — Override the Business SDK's default HTTP service and implement your own custom service with your preferred method or library.

## Integration as a platform {#integration-as-a-platform}

The following instructions are for partners offering the Conversions API as a service to advertisers.

### Step 1: Set up requirements

Your app should get the following features and permissions:

- Access Level: [advanced access](get-started/authorization.md#layer-2--access-levels--permissions--and-features)
- Feature: [Marketing API Access Tier](get-started/authorization.md)
- Permissions: [`ads_management`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/ads_management) or [`business_management`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions#business_management) and [`pages_read_engagement`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_read_engagement) and [`ads_read`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/ads_read).

### Step 2: Send events on behalf of clients

#### 1. Facebook Login for Business (recommended for partners)

[Facebook Login for Business](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/facebook-login-for-business#opt-in-to-facebook-login-for-business) is the preferred authentication and authorization solution for Tech Providers and business app developers who need access to their business clients' assets. It allows you to specify the access token type, types of assets, and permissions your app needs, and save it as a set (configuration). You can then present the set to your business clients who can complete the flow and grant your app access to their business assets.

#### 2. Meta Business Extension

[Meta Business Extension](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-business-extension) returns all the necessary information needed to send events on behalf of the client via the following process. Meta Business Extension provides an endpoint to retrieve system user access tokens created in the client's Business Manager. This process includes permissions to send server events and is done automatically and in a secured way.

The endpoint requires the user access token as input parameter. For new Meta Business Extension users, call this endpoint the endpoint to fetch the system user access token after you finish setting up Meta Business Extension. Existing users need to ask for re-authentication before calling the new API endpoint.

**Warning:** Facebook Business Extension is currently only available to approved partners. If you are interested in becoming a partner, contact your Meta representative for access.

#### 3. Business on behalf of: client shares dataset to the partner's Business Manager

The client shares their dataset to the partner via Business Manager settings, see 'Client system user's access token' section  or via [API through the On Behalf Of onboarding method](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/business-manager/guides/on-behalf-of). You can assign the partner system user to the client pixel and generate an access token to send server events by manually creating a System User Access Token. This can be done via the Conversions API inside the pixel settings above. On the API side, you need to request access to the [client's ad account](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/business-asset-management/guides/business-to-business#managing-your-relationship-as-an-ad-agency-acting-on-behalf-of-another-business) managing the dataset and [proceed sharing pixels via API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/business-asset-management/guides/business-pixel-sharing).  

#### 4. Client system user's access token

This is the similar onboarding flow for direct integration. You will have your client [manually create a System User Access Token](conversions-api/set-up-conversions-api-as-a-platform.md#option1) via the Conversions API inside the dataset settings. Then, you can send events to the advertiser's dataset with that token. A system user or an admin system user must install the app that will be used to generate the access token. With this setup, your app is allowed to call APIs on behalf of this system user or admin system user.

**Warning:** **Note**: If the partner system leverages this method, their token will be limited to sending data only to Meta. The token can't be used to run API GET data requests.

### Step 3: Attribute events to your platform
To attribute Conversions API events to your platform, use the `partner_agent` field. This allows you to set your own platform identifier when sending events on behalf of a client. If you are a managed partner, work with your Meta Representative to agree on an identifier for your platform. This value should be in a format that is less than 23 characters and includes at least two alphabetical characters. Then, send it with each server event.

**Note:** Always provide an up-to-date setup guide for advertisers looking to activate the integration on your platform.
