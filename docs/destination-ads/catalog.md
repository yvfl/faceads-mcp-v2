# Destination Ads - Catalog & Feed



To promote destinations on Facebook, you have to share information about them with Facebook. You do this by creating a destination catalog and then filling it with destinations.

[Upload CSV or XML files for 'destination feeds' with the destinations you want to promote](#upload-destination-feed)

You can create and manage your destination catalog in your [Commerce Manager](https://www.facebook.com/products).

To use the API to manage your catalog:

1. [Create a destination catalog](#destination-catalog)
2. [Upload your feed to Facebook](#feed-upload)
3. [Create product sets out of your destination catalog](#destination-catalog)
4. [Associate the catalog to your event sources](#event-sources)

## Destination feed - upload your destinations to Facebook {#upload-destination-feed}

A destination feed is a file with the destinations you want to promote. Every line or item in the file represents a single destination. You can use one or more destination feeds, as long as all feeds together contain all destinations you want to promote.

### Supported destination feed formats

#### CSV - sample and description
[CSV sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=destination_example.csv) | [TSV sample (flattened)](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_destinations_flattened.tsv) | [TSV sample (JSON-style)](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_destinations_json.tsv)

* The first row must list the chosen field names in the order the values will be given. Subsequent rows then supply the corresponding values for each destination.
* Fields containing whitespace or commas should be enclosed in `"`double quotes`"`.
* Nested or multi-value fields, such as `address`, `neighborhood` or `image` can be represented using JSON-encoded values or by a set of "flattened" plain-text columns labeled using JSON-path syntax, such as `address.city`, `neighborhood[0]`, `image[0].url`, `image[0].tag[0]`, `image[0].tag[1]`. Both conventions can be used interchangeably in the same file.

#### XML - sample and description
[XML sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_destination_feed.xml)

* A root `<listings>` XML node encloses a set of `<listing>` nodes, each of which represents a destination.
* The file must begin with a valid `<?xml` declaration tag.

The feed parser automatically detects `UTF8`, `UTF16`, or `UTF32` text encodings, and defaults to `LATIN1` if it encounters an unexpected byte sequences. You can provide text in field values in any language; **however, field names must be given exactly as below, in English.**

### Supported fields - destinations {#supported-fields-destination}

The following supported fields are designed for items you add to your product catalog.

For localized catalogs, see [supported fields for destinations](catalog/reference.md#loc-cat-destination).
| Field Name and Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `destination_id`<br><br>type: string | **Required**.<br><br>Max length: 100<br><br>Your unique identifier for the destination within the catalog.

For example, you could add a "summer" label to all items that are part of a summer promotion and then filter those items into a set. Labels are only visible to you<br><br>Enclose each label in single quotes (') and separate multiple labels with commas (,). Don't include white spaces at the beginning or end of a label. Character limit: Up to 5,000 labels per product and 110 characters per label.  <br><br>Example (TSV, XLSX, Google Sheets): ['summer','trending']<br><br>Example (CSV): "['summer','trending']"<br><br>**Note**: If you're currently using custom labels (`custom_label_0` to `custom_label_4`) for filtering product sets, switching to internal labels (`internal_label`) instead is recommended. Unlike custom labels, you can add or update internal labels as often as needed without sending items through policy review each time, which can impact ad delivery.<br><br>**Warning:** This field was previously called `product_tags`. The old field name is still supported, but use the new name `internal_label`. |

## Product deep links
[Provide deep links](catalog/guides/product-deep-links.md) in feed following the [App Links](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/applinks) specification. Deep link information in feed takes precedence over any information Facebook collects with App Links metadata with our web crawler.

If you already have deep link information from App Links, you don't need to specify this data. Facebook uses information from App Links to display the correct deep link. To display deep links in your ads, see [Advantage+ Catalog Ads, Ad Template](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/dynamic-product-ads/ads-management#adtemplate).

## Image object parameters {#image-object}

There can be multiple tags associated with an image.<br><br>Examples: `Fitness Center`, `Swimming Pool`<br><br>`INSTAGRAM_STANDARD_PREFERRED` - Allows advertisers to tag a specific image in their feed as the default image that will be used for Instagram. This tag is case sensitive. |

## Address object parameters {#address-object}
**Note:** Nested or multi-value fields, such as `address` can be represented using JSON-encoded values or by a set of "flattened" plain-text columns labeled using JSON-path syntax, such as `address.region`. Both conventions can be used interchangeably in the same file.

**The following sections are only relevant to manage your catalogs using this API.**

## Create a destination catalog using the API {#destination-catalog}

A destination catalog is a container for the destinations you want to promote. To use the catalog API, make sure you have the appropriate [Marketing API Access Level](get-started/authorization.md#limits) and that you have accepted the [Terms of Service](https://business.facebook.com/legal/product_catalog_terms/) by creating your first catalog through [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com).

To create a destination catalog for destination ads, set `vertical` to `destinations`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Destination Catalog"' \
  -F 'vertical="destinations"' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v10.0/BUSINESS_ID/owned_product_catalogs
```

## Upload your destination feeds via the API {#feed-upload}

Once you have created the catalog, you must upload your destination feed(s) to Facebook. Use the API to create a feed object for every feed you want to upload. Scheduled and direct uploads are supported.

For scheduled uploads, specify a schedule when you create the feed. For non scheduled uploads, don't specify a schedule.

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Feed"' \
  -F 'schedule={
       "interval": "DAILY",
       "url": "http://www.example.com/sample_feed.tsv",
       "hour": "22"
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/product_feeds
```

In either case, the response is:

```
{ "id" : <PRODUCT_FEED_ID> }
```

Once you have created the feed (with or without schedule), you can do a one time upload of your feed using the `PRODUCT_FEED_ID`:

```
curl \
-F "url=http://www.example.com/sample_feed.xml" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PRODUCT_FEED_ID>/uploads
```

For scheduled uploads, specify a schedule when you create the feed. For non scheduled uploads, don't specify a schedule.

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Feed"' \
  -F 'schedule={
       "interval": "DAILY",
       "url": "http://www.example.com/sample_feed.tsv",
       "hour": "22"
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/product_feeds
```

In either case, the response is:

```json
{ "id" : <PRODUCT_FEED_ID> }
```

Once you have created the feed (with or without schedule), you can do a one time upload of your feed using the `PRODUCT_FEED_ID`:

```bash
curl \
-F "url=http://www.example.com/sample_feed.xml" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PRODUCT_FEED_ID>/uploads
```

## Filter destination catalog to destination sets {#create-destination-set}

A destination set is a subset of your catalog. To setup destination ads, you need a destination set. Therefore, you have to create at least one.

Destination sets are defined by filters that are applied to the destination catalog. For example, you can create a destination set with all destinations that had a large price drop. Do note you can also create a destination set without any filters. When you create a destination set without filters, the destination set will contain all destinations in your catalog.

```html
curl \
  -F 'name=Test Destination Set' \
  -F 'filter={"price_change":{"lt":-20}}' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/product_sets
```

The `filter` parameter is made up of the following operators and data:

| Operators | Filter Type |
| --- | --- |
| `i_contains` | Contains substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `i_not_contains` | Does not contain substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `contains` | Contains substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `not_contains` | Does not contain substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `eq` | Equal to. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `neq` | Not equal to. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `lt` | Less than. For numeric fields only. |
| `lte` | Less than or equal to. For numeric fields only. |
| `gt` | Greater than. For numeric fields only. |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal to. For numeric fields only. |

| Data | The data being filtered |
| --- | --- |
| `country` | Country of the destination. |
| `price` | Price for this destination. The price is in cents. |
| `currency` | Currency. |
| `price_change` | Price drop or increase. |
| `city` | City of the destination. |
| `description` | Description for this destination. |
| `name` | Name for this destination. |
| `destination_set_id` | Your unique identifier for the destination within the catalog. |

## Associate the Catalog to Your Event Sources {#event-sources}

To map the data from your event sources (your pixels and app events) to your catalog, every catalog must be associated with these event sources:

1. Go to your [business manager's catalog page](https://business.facebook.com/settings/product-catalogs/) and click **Associate Sources**.
2. Select the app and pixel that are receiving the travel events. Alternatively, you can use the API.

```html
curl \
  -F 'external_event_sources=["<PIXEL_ID>","<APP_ID>"]' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/external_event_sources
```

When making the API call, specify the following parameters:

| Parameter Name & Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `external_event_sources`<br><br>type: `int[]` | A list of Pixel and App IDs to associate with the catalog. |
