# Destination Ads - Template Tags



When you create destination ads, use these template tags in the ad creative and deep-link URLs. When Facebook displays your ad, we replace the template tags with that person's travel selections.

**You should provide template tags in double curly brackets**: `{{....}}`

**Before using template tags, make sure you provide all required details through your [Destination Events](destination-ads/events.md)**.

For example, the title of your ad could be:

> Book your travel to `{{destination.city}}` today!

And the template URL of your ad could deep link people straight to the destination page they were interested in, with the right travel dates:

> `https://www.(...).com/destinations?id={{destination.destination_id}}&start={{trip.travel_start date_format:Y-m-d}}&end={{trip.travel_end date_format:Y-m-d}}`

## Dynamic Dates {#dates}

Dynamic dates for template tags enable you to continuously update the dates that appear in your ad, without having to re-upload the data in feed. You can use these for Advantage+ catalog ads used in a particular vertical, such as for hotels, flights, destinations, automotive and so on.

- For syntax and usage, see [Template Tags for Hotels, Dynamic Dates](hotel-ads/template-tags.md#dates).
- For available options, see [Template Tags for Hotels, Date Template Tags](hotel-ads/template-tags.md#datetag).

### Template tags for Destinations
