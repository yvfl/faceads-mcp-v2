# Opportunity Score and Recommendations



[Opportunity score](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/804913634782260) and [recommendations](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2086509315182746) enable advertisers to discover and implement best practices that can optimize their ad campaigns with Meta. This guide will help you understand the components of opportunity score and how to integrate them with your application.

Opportunity score is a tool for understanding how well-optimized an ad account is for achieving optimal performance and generates recommendations that could improve performance. It consists of two parts:

1. Your opportunity score (range: 0–100) — Reflects how optimized your ad account is. A higher score indicates better optimality and a greater likelihood of improved performance over time.
- Opportunity score is provided as a [field of an ad account](reference/ad-account.md#fields).
- Opportunity score is updated in near real-time in response to campaign changes and the application of available recommendations.

2. Recommendations — Experimentally-proven best practices that are personalized to each ad account. They may relate to your campaigns, ad sets, or ads, and have been rigorously tested to show they can deliver statistically significant performance improvements.\*
- Implementing recommendations will improve setup and increase opportunity score.
- Recommendations have assigned point values based on how much each is expected to improve your campaign performance.\*
- You may see recommendations related to a variety of categories including campaign objectives and goals, audience, automation, creative, and placements, budget, and bidding, or signals.

\* **Note:** Meta is frequently testing new types of recommendations on the Ads Manager Web UI. Under certain circumstances, there could be fewer recommendations returned by the API versus what is shown in Ads Manager.

By applying performance recommendations from Meta, you agree to the [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) including your obligation to comply with the [Self-serve ad terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/self_service_ads_terms), the [Commercial terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms), and the [Facebook Advertising Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads).

## Supported inventory and APIs

### Fetching recommendations

To fetch all the recommendations available for your ad account, make a `GET` request to the `/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/recommendations` endpoint where `<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>` is the ID for your Meta ad account. Alternatively, you can fetch all the recommendations available for ad accounts across your [business portfolio](reference/business.md) by replacing `act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>` with `<BUSINESS_ID>`.

#### Example ad account request

```bash
curl -G \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/recommendations
```

#### Example business portfolio request

```html
curl -G \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<BUSINESS_ID>/recommendations
```

Optional query parameters for the business portfolio request.
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ad_account_ids`<br>*list<numeric string>* | Optional. Comma-separated ad account IDs without the `act_` prefix, restricting the response to a subset of the Business's owned ad accounts. Maximum **100** per request. When supplied, pagination is disabled and all matching accounts are returned. |
| `recommendation_stages`<br>*list<string>* | Optional. Filter by recommendation lifecycle stage. Supported values include `mid_flight_recommendation` and `pre_create_guidance`. |
| `recommendation_names`<br>*list<string>* | Optional. Filter to specific recommendation names in lowercase snake case, such as `fragmentation` and `aplusc_standard_enhancements_bundle`. |
| `locale`<br>*string* | Optional. Locale for human-readable strings inside `recommendation_content`, such as `en_US`. Defaults to the viewer's locale. |
| `fields`<br>*list<string>* | Optional. API field expansion. Use `recommendation_content` to include the `lift_estimate` and `body` strings, which are omitted by default. |
| `limit`<br>*integer* | Optional. Page size for ad-account-level cursor pagination. Default `25`, maximum `100`. Ignored when `ad_account_ids` is supplied. |
| `after` / `before`<br>*cursor string* | Optional. Cursors returned in `paging.cursors` on the previous response. |

\* Note: There are a few limitations for a Business ID:

- Returns recommendations only for ad accounts **owned** by the Business ID.
- Pagination is at the business account level, with a maximum of 100 ad accounts per page. Supplying `ad_account_ids` disables pagination, with a maximum of 100 IDs per request.

#### Example response

On success, your app receives a list of recommendations that Meta has generated. If this list is empty, Meta has not identified any changes that can be made to increase the ad performance in your ad account.

These help optimize campaign, ad set, or ad configuration before publishing.<br>- **mid_flight_recommendation** - Recommendations for active, running ad objects. These identify optimization opportunities or issues with published campaigns, ad sets, or ads. |
| `recommendation_time` | The timestamp in ISO 8601 of when the recommendation is created. Generally, recommendations have an expiration time. Stale or old recommendations cannot be applied and will fail during apply. |
| `recommendation_name` | Available on Business-level requests only. Recommendation name, such as `fragmentation`. |

### Applying recommendations

There are three options for MAPI powered apps to enable users to apply recommendations for improving opportunity scores. Which option is right for your application will depend on the experience you want to deliver to your user.

#### Option 1: Apply via Deep Link URL to Ads Manager

Each recommendation includes a URL to Ads Manager where your user can review and apply changes directly. This is the simplest path and is ideal for apps that do not traditionally perform campaign management functions such as reporting focused solutions like dashboards.

#### Option 2: Apply via API

For recommendations that support it, use the `POST /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/recommendations` endpoint to apply changes directly to the ad account. This is ideal for apps that already support campaign management functionality and want to provide a one-click apply experience such as toggling Advantage+ settings for a set of campaigns.

#### Option 3: Apply via custom workflow using campaign management APIs

Use the ad object IDs returned with each recommendation to build a custom workflow to draft the changes to be made and use standard Campaign, Ad Set, and Ad APIs to POST the changes. This is ideal for apps that already perform campaign management functions where users expect granular control to draft, review, and publish changes. An example of this is launching a native budget reallocation workflow for determining the precise budget adjustments to make.

#### Apply via API details

To apply a recommendation for your ad account, make a `POST` request to the `/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/recommendations` endpoint where <AD_ACCOUNT_ID> is the ID for your Meta ad account.

**Note:** All requests require a `recommendation_signature` field which is obtained from the recommendation object.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -d 'recommendation_signature="1234567"' \
  -d 'extra_data={"object_selection": "7656787679008"}' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/recommendations
```

#### Example response

On success, your app receives a Boolean value denoting whether the recommendation was successfully applied. If it was not successfully applied, your ad objects will remain unchanged.

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Best practices for querying ads

### Use time range filters

When querying for ads using the Marketing API, it is highly recommended to always apply a time range filter to your requests. This best practice ensures that your queries are efficient, performant, and return only the relevant data you need. By specifying a time range, you reduce the amount of data processed and transferred, which helps avoid unnecessary load on the system and improves response times.

For example, when using an API endpoint such as `/{ad-account-id}/ads`, you should include parameters that define the `start` and `end` dates for your query. This not only aligns with the performance recommendations outlined in this guide, but also helps you avoid common pitfalls like timeouts or excessive data retrieval.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -G \
  -d "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -d "limit=200" \
  -d "effective_status=['ACTIVE','PAUSED']" \
  -d "fields=id,name,created_time,updated_time" \
  -d "time_range={'since':'2025-12-01','until':'2025-12-15'}" \
  -d "summary=true" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads"
```

In this example, the `time_range` parameter restricts the results to ads active between December 1, 2025, and December 15, 2025. Always tailor the time range to your specific use case to maximize query performance and relevance.
