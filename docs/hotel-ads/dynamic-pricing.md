# Hotel Ads - Date-Specific Pricing



In a [static hotel feed](hotel-ads/catalog.md), you provide a single price for each hotel. This price can't vary based on check-in date, length of stay, or room type. To display more accurate prices in your ads based on these variables, use dynamic (date-specific) pricing to provide prices for individual combinations of date, room type, and length of stay. Once you upload the pricing data, you can use [hotel template tags](hotel-ads/template-tags.md) to display these prices in your ads.

Use [batch upload room types and pricing data](#batch-upload) to share pricing details with Facebook.

See [room and pricing parameters](#pricing-parameters) for an explanation of all parameters.

## Batch upload room types and pricing data {#batch-upload}

Batch upload consists of two parts:

1. [Upload Room Types](#upload-room-types)
2. [Upload Pricing](#upload-pricing)

If you use batch upload, limit uploads to 50 MB per file, approximately 50,000 items in a file. Make more frequent, smaller updates for pricing variables.

### Upload room types {#upload-room-types}

Upload one or more files with room types using the [Hotel Rooms Batch API](reference/product-catalog/hotel_rooms_batch.md).

**Note**: If you don't have different room types, you can skip this step.

```
curl \
  -X POST \
  -F file=@hotel_rooms_data_xml.xml \
  -F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/hotel_rooms_batch
```

#### Room types file format

You can provide the room types in **XML** format; see [sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_rooms.xml).

You should identify each hotel by `<property>` in the  `<PropertyDataSet>` XML node and provide room type by `<RoomData>`. Your file must begin with a `<?xml` declaration tag.

For more details on updating and deleting room types through batch API, see [Hotel Rooms, Batch Reference](reference/product-catalog/hotel_rooms_batch.md).

### Upload pricing {#upload-pricing}

Upload one or more files with pricing details using the [Pricing Variable Batch API](reference/product-catalog/pricing_variables_batch.md). You can upload pricing details with or without room types.

**Note**: If you only have a very small number of rooms, you can also use the [Hotel Room API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/hotel-room) to create room types and setup pricing.

```
curl \
  -X POST \
  -F file=@pricings_data_xml.xml \
  -F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/pricing_variables_batch
```

#### Pricing file format {#batch-pricing-variable-format}

Before you upload pricing, make sure the hotels for these rooms already exist in the catalog. You can provide pricing variables in this format:

| File Format and Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| XML with room types \| [XML Sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_pricing_variables_room_types.xml) | **Make sure the room types you want to provide pricing for already exist.**<br><br>Specify pricing (`<Baserate>`) **within** each room type (`<RoomBundle>`) based on the combination of check in date (`<Checkin>`) and length of stay (`<Nights>`). <br>The file must begin with the `<?xml` declaration tag. |
| XML without room types \| [XML Sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_no_room_pricing_variables.xml) | Specify pricing (`<Baserate>`) for each combination of hotel ID (`<Property>`), check in date (`<Checkin>`), and length of stay (`<Nights>`). <br>The file must begin with the `<?xml` declaration tag. |

For more details on how to update and delete pricing variables through batch, see [Pricing Variable Batch Reference](reference/product-catalog/pricing_variables_batch.md).
