# Hotel Ads - Template Tags



When you create hotel ads, use these template tags in the ad creative and deep-link URLs. When Facebook displays your ad, the template tags are replaced with that person's travel selections.

### Guidelines

* Provide template tags in double curly brackets: `{{....}}`

* Before using template tags, provide all required details through your [Hotel Events](hotel-ads/events.md).

For example, the title of your ad could be:

Complete your booking to `{{hotel.city}}` today!

And the template URL of your ad could deep link people straight to the hotel page they were interested in, with the right check-in and check-out date:

> `https://www.(...).com/hotels?id={{hotel.hotel_id}}&checkin={{trip.checkin_date date_format:Y-m-d}}&checkout={{trip.checkout_date date_format:Y-m-d}}`

## Dynamic dates {#dates}

Dynamic dates for template tags enable you to continuously update the dates that appear in your ad, without having to re-upload the data in feed. You can use these for Advantage+ catalog ads used for a particular vertical, such as for hotels, flights, destinations, automotive, and so on. You can specify the following options with these tags:

- Today
- Today, plus or minus `n` days
- Today, plus or minus `n` months
- Today, plus or minus `n` years

The syntax for these tags is as follows:

```
Today:
{{date.today}}

Today + 12 days:
{{date.today date_offset:+12d}}

Today - 12 days:
{{date.today date_offset:-12d}}

Today + 3 months:
{{date.today date_offset:+3m}}

Today + 3 years:
{{date.today date_offset:+3y}}
```

By default, UTC is used; however, you can override with a specific time zone. For example:

```
{{date.today date_timezone:PST}}
```
