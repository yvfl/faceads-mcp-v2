# Hotel ads - Catalogs and feed



To promote your hotel inventory on Facebook, you have to share information about your hotels with Facebook. You do this by creating a hotel catalog and then filling it with hotels. There are two ways you can fill your catalog and update it:

* [Upload CSV or XML files for `hotel feeds` with your hotel inventory](#upload-feed)
* [Create and manage hotels directly in API](#hotel-api)

You can create and manage your hotel catalogs in your [Commerce Manager](https://www.facebook.com/products).

To use the API to manage your catalog:

1. [Create a hotel catalog](#create-catalog)
2. [Create product sets out of your hotel catalog](#product-set)
3. [Associate the catalog to your event sources](#event-sources)

## Hotel feeds: upload your hotels to Facebook {#upload-feed}

A hotel feed is a file with your hotel inventory. Every line or item in the file represents a single hotel. You can use one or more hotel feeds, as long as all feeds together contain your full hotel inventory.

### Supported hotel feed formats

#### CSV
[CSV sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=hotel_feed_flat_example.csv) | [TSV sample (flattened)](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_flattened_feed.tsv) | [TSV sample (JSON style)](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_feed.tsv)

* The first row must list the chosen field names in the order the values are given. Subsequent rows then supply the corresponding values for each hotel.
* Fields containing whitespace or commas should be enclosed in `"`double quotes`"`.
* Nested or multi-value fields, such as `address`, `neighborhood` or `image`, can be represented using JSON-encoded values or by a set of "flattened" plain-text columns labeled using JSON-path syntax, such as `address.city`, `neighborhood[0]`, `image[0].url`, `image[0].tag[0]`, `image[0].tag[1]`. Both conventions can be used interchangeably in the same file.

#### XML
[XML sample](https://lookaside.facebook.com/developers/resources/?id=dat_hotel_feed.xml)

* A root `<listings>` XML node encloses a set of `<listing>` nodes, each of which represents a hotel.
* The file must begin with a valid `<?xml` declaration tag.

The feed parser automatically detects `UTF8`, `UTF16`, or `UTF32` text encodings, and defaults to `LATIN1` if it encounters an unexpected byte sequences. You can provide text in field values in any language; **however, field names must be given exactly as below, in English.**

### Supported fields — hotel ads {#supported-fields-hotel}

The following supported fields are designed for items you add to your product catalog.

## Hotel API: create and manage hotels directly {#hotel-api}

You can use the Hotel API to directly add, edit, and remove hotels in your catalog. Use the [Hotel API Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/hotel) for more information on how to manage hotels using the API.

**The following sections are only relevant to manage your catalogs using this API.**

### Create a hotel catalog using the API {#create-catalog}

A hotel catalog is a container for your hotel inventory. To use the catalog API, make sure you have the appropriate [Marketing API Access Level](get-started/authorization.md#limits) and that you have accepted the [Terms of Service](https://business.facebook.com/legal/product_catalog_terms/) by creating your first catalog through [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com).

To create a hotel catalog for hotel ads, set `vertical` to `hotels`:

```
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Hotel Catalog"' \
  -F 'vertical="hotels"' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v10.0/BUSINESS_ID/owned_product_catalogs
```

## Upload your hotel feeds via the API {#feed-upload}

Once you've created the catalog, you must upload your hotel feed(s) to Facebook. Use the API to create a feed object for every feed you want to upload. Scheduled and direct uploads are supported.

For scheduled uploads, specify a schedule when you create the feed. For non scheduled uploads, don't specify a schedule.

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Feed"' \
  -F 'schedule={
       "interval": "DAILY",
       "url": "http://www.example.com/sample_feed.tsv",
       "hour": "22"
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/product_feeds
```

In either case, the response is:

```
{ "id" : <PRODUCT_FEED_ID> }
```

Once you have created the feed (with or without schedule), you can do a one time upload of your feed using the `PRODUCT_FEED_ID`:

```
curl \
-F "url=http://www.example.com/sample_feed.xml" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PRODUCT_FEED_ID>/uploads
```

## Filter hotel catalog to hotel sets {#product-set}

A hotel set is a subset of your catalog. To set up hotel ads, you need a hotel set. Therefore, you need to create at least one.

Hotel sets are defined by filters that are applied to the hotel catalog. For example, you can create a hotel set with all hotels with a `star_rating` greater than 3. **Note**: You can also create a hotel set without any filters. When you create a set without filters, the hotel set will contain all hotels in your catalog.

To create a hotel set containing all the hotels that contain 'sample brand' mentioned in the `brand` field:

```html
curl -X POST \
  -F 'name="Test Hotel Set"' \
  -F 'filter={
       "brand": {
         "i_contains": "sample brand"
       }
     }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/product_sets
```

The `filter` parameter is made up of the following operators and data:

| Operators | Filter Type |
| --- | --- |
| `i_contains` | Contains substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `i_not_contains` | Does not contain substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `contains` | Contains substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `not_contains` | Does not contain substring. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `eq` | Equal to. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `neq` | Not equal to. Operator is case-insensitive. |
| `lt` | Less than. For numeric fields only. |
| `lte` | Less than or equal to. For numeric fields only. |
| `gt` | Greater than. For numeric fields only. |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal to. For numeric fields only. |

| Data | The data being filtered. |
| --- | --- |
| `hotel_id` | Your unique identifier for the hotel within the catalog. |
| `brand` | Brand of the hotel chain. |
| `base_price_amount` | Base price per night for this hotel. The price is in cents (4999 denotes $49.99). |
| `sale_price_amount` | Sale price per night for this hotel. The price is in cents (4999 denotes $49.99). |
| `currency` | Currency |
| `city` | City where hotel is located. |
| `country` | Country of the hotel. |
| `name` | The most common name of the hotel. |
| `star_rating` | Hotel star rating. The valid values are between 1 to 5 and should be a multiple of 0.5. |

## Associate the Catalog to Your Event Sources {#event-sources}

To map the data from your event sources (your pixels and app events) to your catalog, every catalog must be associated with these event sources:

1. Go to your [business manager's catalog page](https://business.facebook.com/settings/product-catalogs/) and click **Associate Sources**.
2. Select the app and pixel that are receiving the travel events. Alternatively, you can use the API.

```html
curl \
  -F 'external_event_sources=["<PIXEL_ID>","<APP_ID>"]' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/<PRODUCT_CATALOG_ID>/external_event_sources
```

When making the API call, specify the following parameters:

| Parameter Name & Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `external_event_sources`<br><br>type: `int[]` | A list of Pixel and App IDs to associate with the catalog. |
